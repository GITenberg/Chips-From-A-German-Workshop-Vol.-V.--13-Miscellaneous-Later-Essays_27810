Presidential Address Delivered Before The
Birmingham Midland Institute,
October 20, 1879.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not more than twenty years have passed since
John Stuart Mill sent forth his plea for Liberty.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If there is one among the leaders of thought in
England who, by the elevation of his character and
the calm composure of his mind, deserved the so often
misplaced title of Serene Highness, it was, I
think, John Stuart Mill.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in his Essay <span class="tei tei-q">“On Liberty,”</span> Mill for once becomes
passionate. In presenting his Bill of Rights,
in stepping forward as the champion of individual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
liberty, he seems to be possessed by a new spirit. He
speaks like a martyr, or the defender of martyrs.
The individual human soul, with its unfathomable
endowments, and its capacity of growing to something
undreamt of in our philosophy, becomes in his
eyes a sacred thing, and every encroachment on its
world-wide domain is treated as sacrilege. Society,
the arch-enemy of the rights of individuality, is represented
like an evil spirit, whom it behooves every
true man to resist with might and main, and whose
demands, as they cannot be altogether ignored, must
be reduced at all hazards to the lowest level.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I doubt whether any of the principles for which
Mill pleaded so warmly and strenuously in his Essay
<span class="tei tei-q">“On Liberty”</span> would at the present day be challenged
or resisted, even by the most illiberal of philosophers,
or the most conservative of politicians.
Mill's demands sound very humble to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> ears. They
amount to no more than this, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the individual is
not accountable to society for his actions so far as
they concern the interests of no person but himself,
and that he may be subjected to social or legal punishments
for such actions only as are prejudicial to
the interests of others.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Is there any one here present who doubts the justice
of that principle, or who would wish to reduce
the freedom of the individual to a smaller measure?
Whatever social tyranny may have existed twenty
years ago, when it wrung that fiery protest from the
lips of John Stuart Mill, can we imagine a state of
society, not totally Utopian, in which the individual
man need be less ashamed of his social fetters, in
which he could more freely utter all his honest convictions,
more boldly propound all his theories, more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fearlessly agitate for their speedy realization; in
which, in fact, each man can be so entirely himself
as the society of England, such as it now is, such as
generations of hard-thinking and hard-working Englishmen
have made it, and left it as the most sacred
inheritance to their sons and daughters?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Look through the whole of history, not excepting
the brightest days of republican freedom at Athens
and Rome, and you will not find one single period in
which the measure of liberty accorded to each individual
was larger than it is at present, at least in
England. And if you wish to realize the full blessings
of the time in which we live, compare Mill's plea
for Liberty with another written not much more than
two hundred years ago, and by a thinker not inferior
either in power or boldness to Mill himself. According
to Hobbes, the only freedom which an individual
in his ideal state has a right to claim is what he calls
<span class="tei tei-q">“freedom of thought,”</span> and that freedom of thought
consists in our being able to think what we like—so
long as we keep it to ourselves. Surely, such freedom
of thought existed even in the days of the Inquisition,
and we should never call thought free, if it
had to be kept a prisoner in solitary and silent confinement.
By freedom of thought we mean freedom
of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of action,
whether individual or associated, and of that freedom
the present generation, as compared with all former
generations, the English nation, as compared with all
other nations, enjoys, there can be no doubt, a good
measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and
sometimes running over.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be said that some dogmas still remain in
politics, in religion, and in morality; but those who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
defend them claim no longer any infallibility, and
those who attack them, however small their minority,
need fear no violence, nay, may reckon on an impartial
and even sympathetic hearing, as soon as people
discover in their pleadings the true ring of honest
conviction and the warmth inspired by an unselfish
love of truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has seemed strange, therefore, to many readers
of Mill, particularly on the Continent, that this plea
for liberty, this demand for freedom for every individual
to be what he is, and to develop all the germs of
his nature, should have come from what is known as
the freest of all countries, England. We might well
understand such a cry of indignation if it had reached
us from Russia; but why should English philosophers,
of all others, have to protest against the tyranny of
society? It is true, nevertheless, that in countries
governed despotically, the individual, unless he is
obnoxious to the Government, enjoys far greater
freedom, or rather license, than in a country like
England, which governs itself. Russian society, for
instance, is extremely indulgent. It tolerates in its
rulers and statesmen a haughty defiance of the simplest
rules of social propriety, and it seems amused
rather than astonished or indignant at the vagaries,
the frenzies, and outrages of those who in brilliant
drawing-rooms or lecture-rooms preach the doctrines
of what is called Nihilism or Individualism,<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>—viz.,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that society must be regenerated by a struggle for
existence and the survival of the strongest, processes
which Nature has sanctioned, and which have proved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
successful among wild animals.”</span> If there is danger
in these doctrines the Government is expected to see
to it. It may place watchmen at the doors of every
house and at the corner of every street, but it must
not count on the better classes coming forward to
enrol themselves as special constables, or even on the
coöperation of public opinion which in England would
annihilate that kind of Nihilism with one glance of
scorn and pity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a self-governed country like England, the resistance
which society, if it likes, can oppose to the
individual in the assertion of his rights, is far more
compact and powerful than in Russia, or even in
Germany. Even where it does not employ the arm
of the law, society knows how to use that quieter,
but more crushing pressure, that calm, Gorgon-like
look which only the bravest and stoutest hearts know
how to resist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is against that indirect repression which a well-organized
society exercises, both through its male
and female representatives, that Mill's demand for
liberty seems directed. He does not stand up for
unlimited individualism; on the contrary, he would
have been the most strenuous defender of that balance
of power between the weak and the strong on
which all social life depends. But he resents those
smaller penalties which society will always inflict on
those who disturb its dignified peace and comfort:—avoidance,
exclusion, a cold look, a stinging remark.
Had Mill any right to complain of these social penalties?
Would it not rather amount to an interference
with individual liberty to deprive any individual or
any number of individuals of those weapons of self-defence?
Those who themselves think and speak
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
freely, have hardly a right to complain, if others
claim the same privilege. Mill himself called the
Conservative party the stupid party <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">par excellence</span></span>,
and he took great pains to explain that it was so
not by accident, but by necessity. Need he wonder
if those whom he whipped and scourged used their
own whips and scourges against so merciless a critic?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Freethinkers—and I use that name as a title of
honor for all who, like Mill, claim for every individual
the fullest freedom in thought, word, or deed,
compatible with the freedom of others—are apt to
make one mistake. Conscious of their own honest
intentions, they cannot bear to be misjudged or
slighted. They expect society to submit to their
often very painful operations as a patient submits
to the knife of the surgeon. This is not in human
nature. The enemy of abuses is always abused by
his enemies. Society will never yield one inch without
resistance, and few reformers live long enough
to receive the thanks of those whom they have reformed.
Mill's unsolicited election to Parliament
was a triumph not often shared by social reformers;
it was as exceptional as Bright's admission to a seat
in the Cabinet, or Stanley's appointment as Dean of
Westminster. Such anomalies will happen in a
country fortunately so full of anomalies as England;
but, as a rule, a political reformer must not be angry
if he passes through life without the title of Right
Honorable; nor should a man, if he will always
speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, be disappointed if he dies a martyr rather
than a Bishop.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But even granting that in Mill's time there existed
some traces of social tyranny, where are they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
now? Look at the newspapers and the journals.
Is there any theory too wild, any reform too violent,
to be openly defended? Look at the drawing-rooms
or the meetings of learned societies. Are not the
most eccentric talkers the spoiled children of the
fashionable world? When young lords begin to
discuss the propriety of limiting the rights of inheritance,
and young tutors are not afraid to propose curtailing
the long vacation, surely we need not complain
of the intolerance of English society.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whenever I state these facts to my German and
French and Italian friends, who from reading Mill's
Essay <span class="tei tei-q">“On Liberty”</span> have derived the impression
that, however large an amount of political liberty
England may enjoy, it enjoys but little of intellectual
freedom, they are generally willing to be converted
so far as London, or other great cities are concerned.
But look at your Universities, they say, the nurseries
of English thought! Compare their mediæval spirit,
their monastic institutions, their scholastic philosophy,
with the freshness and freedom of the Continental
Universities! Strong as these prejudices
about Oxford and Cambridge have long been, they
have become still more intense since Professor Helmholtz,
in an inaugural address which he delivered at
his installation as Rector of the University of Berlin,
lent to them the authority of his great name.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The tutors,”</span> he says,<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“in the English Universities
cannot deviate by a hair's-breadth from the
dogmatic system of the English Church, without exposing
themselves to the censure of their Archbishops
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and losing their pupils.”</span> In German Universities,
on the contrary, we are told that the extreme
conclusions of materialistic metaphysics, the boldest
speculations within the sphere of Darwin's theory of
evolution, may be propounded without let or hindrance,
quite as much as the highest apotheosis of
Papal infallibility.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here the facts on which Professor Helmholtz relies
are entirely wrong, and the writings of some of
our most eminent tutors supply a more than sufficient
refutation of his statements. Archbishops have
no official position whatsoever in English Universities,
and their censure of an Oxford tutor would be
resented as impertinent by the whole University.
Nor does the University, as such, exercise any very
strict control over the tutors, even when they lecture
not to their own College only. Each Master of Arts
at Oxford claims now the right to lecture (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">venia
docendi</span></span>), and I doubt whether they would submit to
those restrictions which, in Germany, the Faculty
imposes on every <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Privat-docent</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Privat-docents</span></span> in
German Universities have been rejected by the
Faculty for incompetence, and silenced for insubordination.
I know of no such cases at Oxford during
my residence of more than thirty years, nor can I
think it likely that they should ever occur.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the extreme conclusions of materialistic
metaphysics, there are Oxford tutors who have grappled
with the systems of such giants as Hobbes,
Locke, or Hume, and who are not likely to be frightened
by Büchner and Vogt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know comparisons are odious, and I should be
the last man to draw comparisons between English
and German Universities unfavorable to the latter.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But with regard to freedom of thought, of speech,
and action, Professor Helmholtz, if he would spend
but a few weeks at Oxford, would find that we enjoy
it in fuller measure here than the Professors and
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Privat-docents</span></span> in any Continental University. The
publications of some of our professors and tutors
ought at least to have convinced him that if there
is less of brave words and turbulent talk in their
writings, they display throughout a determination to
speak the truth, which may be matched, but could
not easily be excelled, by the leaders of thought in
France, Germany, or Italy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The real difference between English and Continental
Universities is that the former govern themselves,
the latter are governed. Self-government
entails responsibilities, sometimes restraints and reticences.
I may here be allowed to quote the words
of another eminent Professor of the University of
Berlin, Du Bois Reymond, who, in addressing his
colleagues, ventured to tell them,<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“We have still to
learn from the English how the greatest independence
of the individual is compatible with willing
submission to salutary, though irksome, statutes.”</span>
That is particularly true when the statutes are self-imposed.
In Germany, as Professor Helmholtz tells
us himself, the last decision in almost all the more
important affairs of the Universities rests with the
Government, and he does not deny that in times of
political and ecclesiastical tension, a most ill-advised
use has been made of that power. There are, besides,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the less important matters, such as raising of
salaries, leave of absence, scientific missions, even
titles and decorations, all of which enable a clever
Minister of Instruction to assert his personal influence
among the less independent members of the
University. In Oxford the University does not know
the Ministry, nor the Ministry the University. The
acts of the Government, be it Liberal or Conservative,
are freely discussed, and often powerfully resisted
by the academic constituencies, and the personal
dislike of a Minister or Ministerial Councillor
could as little injure a professor or tutor as his favor
could add one penny to his salary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But these are minor matters. What gives their
own peculiar character to the English Universities is
a sense of power and responsibility: power, because
they are the most respected among the numerous
corporations in the country; responsibility, because
the higher education of the whole country has been
committed to their charge. Their only master is
public opinion as represented in Parliament, their
only incentive their own sense of duty. There is no
country in Europe where Universities hold so exalted
a position, and where those who have the honour
to belong to them may say with greater truth <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Noblesse
oblige</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know the dangers of self-government, particularly
where higher and more ideal interests are concerned,
and there are probably few who wish for a
real reform in schools and Universities who have not
occasionally yielded to the desire for a Dictator, of a
Bismarck or a Falk. But such a desire springs only
from a momentary weakness and despondency; and
no one who knows the difference between being governed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and governing one's self, would ever wish to descend
from that higher though dangerous position to
a lower one, however safe and comfortable it might
seem. No one who has tasted the old wine of freedom
would ever really wish to exchange it for the
new wine of external rule. Public opinion is sometimes
a hard master, and majorities can be great
tyrants to those who want to be honest to their own
convictions. But in the struggle of all against all,
each individual feels that he has his rightful place,
and that he may exercise his rightful influence. If
he is beaten, he is beaten in fair fight; if he conquers,
he has no one else to thank. No doubt, despotic
Governments have often exercised the most beneficial
patronage in encouraging and rewarding poets,
artists, and men of science. But men of genius who
have conquered the love and admiration of a whole
nation are greater than those who have gained the
favor of the most brilliant Courts; and we know how
some of the fairest reputations have been wrecked on
the patronage which they had to accept at the hands
of powerful Ministers or ambitious Sovereigns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to return to Mill and his plea for Liberty.
Though I can hardly believe that, were he still
among us, he would claim a larger measure of freedom
for the individual than is now accorded to every
one of us in the society in which we move, yet the
chief cause on which he founded his plea for Liberty,
the chief evil which he thought could be remedied
only if society would allow more elbow-room to individual
genius, exists in the same degree as in his
time—aye, even in a higher degree. The principle
of individuality has suffered more at present than
perhaps at any former period of history. The world
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is becoming more and more gregarious, and what the
French call our <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">nature
moutonnière</span></span>, our tendency to
leap where the sheep in front of us has leapt, becomes
more and more prevalent in politics, in religion,
in art, and even in science. M. de Tocqueville
expressed his surprise how much more Frenchmen of
the present day resemble one another than did those
of the last generation. The same remark, adds John
Stuart Mill, might be made of England in a greater
degree. <span class="tei tei-q">“The modern <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">régime</span></span>
of public opinion,”</span> he
writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“is in an unorganized form what the Chinese
educational and political systems are in an organized;
and unless individuality shall be able successfully to
assert itself against this yoke, Europe, notwithstanding
its noble antecedents and its professed Christianity,
will tend to become another China.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I fully agree with Mill in recognizing the dangers
of uniformity, but I doubt whether what he calls the
<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">régime</span></span>
of public opinion is alone, or even chiefly,
answerable for it. No doubt there are some people
in whose eyes uniformity seems an advantage rather
than a disadvantage. If all were equally strong,
equally educated, equally honest, equally rich, equally
tall, or equally small, society would seem to them to
have reached the highest ideal. The same people
admire an old French garden, with its clipped yew-trees,
forming artificial walls and towers and pyramids,
far more than the giant yews which, like large
serpents, clasp the soil with their coiling roofs, and
overshadow with their dark green branches the white
chalk cliffs of the Thames. But those French gardens,
unless they are constantly clipped and prevented
from growing, soon fall into decay. As in
nature, so in society, uniformity means but too often
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stagnation, while variety is the surest sign of health
and vigor. The deepest secret of nature is its love of
continued novelty. Its tendency, if unrestrained, is
towards constantly creating new varieties, which, if
they fulfil their purpose, become fixed for a time, or,
it may be, forever; while others, after they have fulfilled
their purpose, vanish to make room for new and
stronger types.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same is the secret of human society. It consists
and lives in individuals, each meant to be different
from all the others, and to contribute his own
peculiar share to the common wealth. As no tree
is like any other tree, and no leaf on the same tree
like any other leaf, no human being is, or is meant
to be, exactly like any other human being. It is in
this endless, and to us inconceivable, variety of human
souls that the deepest purpose of human life
is to be realized; and the more society fulfils that
purpose, the more its allows free scope for the development
of every individual germ, the richer will be
the harvest in no distant future. Such is the mystery
of individuality that I do not wonder if even
those philosophers who, like Mill, confine the use of
the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sacred</span></span> within the very smallest compass, see
in each individual soul something sacred, something
to be revered, even where we cannot understand it,
something to be protected against all vulgar violence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Where I differ from Mill and his school is on the
question as to the quarter from whence the epidemic
of uniformity springs which threatens the free development
of modern society. Mill points to the society
in which we move; to those who are in front of us,
to our contemporaries. I feel convinced that our
real enemies are at our back, and that the heaviest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chains which are fastened on us are those made, not
by the present, but by past generations—by our ancestors,
not by our contemporaries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is on this point, on the trammels of individual
freedom with which we may almost be said to be
born into the world, and on the means by which we
may shake off these old chains, or at all events learn
to carry them more lightly and gracefully, that I wish
to speak to you this evening.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You need not be afraid that I am going to enter
upon the much discussed subject of heredity, whether
in its physiological or psychological aspects. It is a
favorite subject just now, and the most curious facts
have been brought together of late to illustrate the
working of what is called heredity. But the more
we know of these facts, the less we seem able to comprehend
the underlying principle. Inheritance is one
of those numerous words which by their very simplicity
and clearness are so apt to darken our counsel.
If a father has blue eyes and the son has blue eyes,
what can be clearer than that he inherited them?
If the father stammers and the son stammers, who
can doubt but that it came by inheritance? If the
father is a musician and the son a musician, we say
very glibly that the talent was inherited. But what
does <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inherited</span></span> mean? In no case does it mean what
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inherited</span></span> usually means—something external, like
money, collected by a father, and, after his death, secured
by law to his son. Whatever else inherited
may mean, it does not mean that. But unfortunately
the word is there, it seems almost pedantic to challenge
its meaning, and people are always grateful if
an easy word saves them the trouble of hard thought.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another apparent advantage of the theory of heredity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is that it never fails. If the son has blue, and
the father black, eyes, all is right again, for either
the mother, or the grandmother, or some historic or
prehistoric ancestor, may have had blue eyes, and atavism,
we know, will assert itself after hundreds and
thousands of years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Do not suppose that I deny the broad facts of what
is called by the name of heredity. What I deny is
that the name of heredity offers any scientific solution
of a most difficult problem. It is a name, a metaphor,
quite as bad as the old metaphor of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">innate
ideas</span></span>; for there is hardly a single point of similarity
between the process by which a son may share
the black eyes, the stammering, or the musical talent
of his father, and that by which, after his father's
death, the law secures to the son the possession of
the pounds, shillings, and pence which his father
held in the Funds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But whatever the true meaning of heredity may
be, certain it is that every individual comes into the
world heavy-laden. Nowhere has the consciousness
of the burden which rests on each generation as it
enters on its journey through life found stronger expression
than among the Buddhists. What other
people call by various names, <span class="tei tei-q">“fate or providence,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“tradition or inheritance,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“circumstances or environment,”</span>
they call <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karman</span></span>,
deed—what has been
done, whether by ourselves or by others, the accumulated
work of all who have come before us, the consequences
of which we have to bear, both for good and
for evil. Originally this <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karman</span></span>
seems to have been conceived as personal, as the work which we
ourselves have done in our former existences. But,
as personally we are not conscious of having done
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
such work in former ages, that kind of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karman</span></span>, too,
might be said to be impersonal. To the question
how <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karman</span></span> began,
what was the nucleus of that
accumulation which forms the condition of present
existence, Buddhism has no answer to give, any more
than any other system of religion or philosophy.
The Buddhists say it began with <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avidyâ</span></span>, and
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avidyâ</span></span>
means ignorance.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>
They are much more deeply interested
in the question how <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karman</span></span> may be
annihilated, how each man may free himself from the influence
of <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karman</span></span>, and
Nirvâ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>a, the highest
object of all their dreams, is often defined by Buddhist philosophers
as <span class="tei tei-q">“freedom from <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karman</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What the Buddhists call by the general name of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karman</span></span>,
comprehends all influences which the past
exercises on the present, whether physical or mental.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>
It is not my object to examine or even to name all
these influences, though I confess nothing is more interesting
than to look upon the surface of our modern
life as we look on a geological map, and to see the
most ancient formations cropping out everywhere
under our feet. Difficult as it is to color a geological
map of England, it would be still more difficult
to find a sufficient variety of colors to mark the different
ingredients of the intellectual condition of her
people.

That all of us, whether we speak English or German,

ancient Oriental tongue, incredible as it would have

everybody. Though the various dialects now spoken
in Europe have been separated many thousands of
years from the Sanskrit, the ancient classical language
of India, yet so close is the bond that holds
the West and East together, that in many cases an
intelligent Englishman might still guess the meaning
of a Sanskrit word. How little difference is there
between Sanskrit <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">sûnu</span></span>

Think how we value a Saxon urn, or a Roman coin,
or a Keltic weapon! how we dig for them, clean
them, label them, and carefully deposit them in our
museums! Yet what is their antiquity compared
with the antiquity of such words as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">son</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">daughter</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">father</span></span> and

than those collected in the handy volumes which we
call Dictionaries, and those who know how to interpret
those English antiquities—as you may see them
interpreted, for instance, in Grimm's Dictionary of
the German, in Littré's Dictionary of the French, or
in Professor Skeats' Etymological Dictionary of the
English Language—will learn more of the real
growth of the human mind than by studying many
volumes on logic and psychology.

And as by our language we belong to the Aryan

If thus in our language we are Aryan, in our letters
Egyptian, we have only to look at our watches to
see that we are Babylonian. Why is our hour divided
into sixty minutes, our minute into sixty seconds?
Would not a division of the hour into ten, or fifty,
or a hundred minutes have been more natural? We
have sixty divisions on the dials of our watches simply
because the Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who
lived in the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span>, accepted the Babylonian
system of reckoning time, that system being
sexagesimal. The Babylonians knew the decimal
system, but for practical purposes they counted by
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sossi</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sari</span></span>, the

representing 60, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">saros</span></span>
60 × 60, or 3,600. From Hipparchus that system
found its way into the works of Ptolemy, about 150

And why are there twenty shillings to our sovereign?
Again the real reason lies in Babylon. The
Greeks learnt from the Babylonians the art of dividing
gold and silver for the purpose of trade. It has
been proved that the current gold piece of Western
Asia was exactly the sixtieth part of a Babylonian
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mnâ</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mina</span></span>.
It was nearly equal to our sovereign.
The difficult problem of the relative value of gold
and silver in a bi-metallic currency had been solved
to a certain extent in the ancient Mesopotamian
kingdom, the proportion between gold and silver being
fixed at 1 to 13-1/3. The silver shekel current in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Babylon was heavier than the gold shekel in the
proportion of 13-1/3 to 10, and had therefore the value
of one tenth of a gold shekel; and the half silver
shekel, called by the Greeks a drachma, was worth
one twentieth of a gold shekel. The drachma, or

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall mention only one more of the most essential
tools of our mental life—namely, our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">figures</span></em>,
which we call Arabic, because we received them from
the Arabs, but which the Arabs called Indian, because
they received them from the Indians—in order
to show you how this nineteenth century of ours is
under the sway of centuries long past and forgotten;
how we are what we are, not by ourselves, but by
those who came before us, and how the intellectual
ground on which we stand is made up of the detritus
of thoughts which were first thought, not on these
isles nor in Europe, but on the shores of the Oxus,
the Nile, the Euphrates, and the Indus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now you may well ask, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quorsum
hæc omnia?</span></span>
What has all this to do with freedom and with the
free development of individuality? Because a man
is born the heir of all the ages, can it be said that he
is not free to grow and to expand, and to develop all
the faculties of his mind? Are those who came before
him, and who left him this goodly inheritance,
to be called his enemies? Is that chain of tradition
which connects him with the past really a galling
fetter, and not rather the leading-strings without
which he would never learn to walk straight?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us look at the matter more closely. No one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would venture to say that every individual should
begin life as a young savage, and be left to form his
own language, and invent his own letters, numerals,
and coins. On the contrary, if we comprehend all
this and a great deal more, such as religion, morality,
and secular knowledge, under the general name of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">education</span></span>, even the most advanced defenders of individualism
would hold that no child should enter society
without submitting, or rather without being
submitted, to education. Most of us would even go
farther, and make it criminal for parents or even for
communities to allow children to grow up uneducated.
The excuse of worthless parents that they are at liberty
to do with their children as they like, has at last
been blown to the winds, and among the principal
advocates of compulsory education, and of the necessity
of curtailing the freedom of savage parents of
savage children, have been Mill and his friends, the
apostles of liberty and individualism.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>
I remember the time when pseudo-Liberals were not ashamed to
say that, whatever other nations, such as the Germans,
might do, England would never submit to
compulsory education; but that faint-hearted and
mischievous cry has at last been silenced. A new
era may be said to date in the history of every nation
from the day on which <span class="tei tei-q">“compulsory education”</span> becomes
part of its statute-book; and I may congratulate
the most Liberal town in England on having
proved itself the most inexorable tyrant in carrying
it into effect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But do not let us imagine that compulsory education
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is without its dangers. Like a powerful engine,
it must be carefully watched, if it is not to produce,
what all compulsion will produce, a slavish receptivity,
and, what all machines do produce, monotonous
uniformity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We know that all education must in the beginning
be purely dogmatic. Children are taught language,
religion, morality, patriotism, and afterwards,
at school, history, literature, mathematics, and all the
rest, long before they are able to question, to judge,
or choose for themselves, and there is hardly anything
that a child will not believe, if it comes from
those in whom the child believes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Reading, writing, and arithmetic, no doubt, must
be taught dogmatically, and they take up an enormous
amount of time, particularly in English schools.
English spelling is a national misfortune, and in the
keen international race among all the countries of
Europe, it handicaps the English child to a degree
that seems incredible till we look at statistics. I
know the difficulties of a Spelling Reform, I know
what people mean when they call it impossible; but
I also know that personal and national virtue consists
in doing so-called impossible things, and that
no nation has done, and has still to do, so many impossible
things as the English.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, granted that reading, writing, and arithmetic
occupy nearly the whole school time and absorb the
best powers of the pupils, cannot something be done
in play-hours? Is there not some work that can be
turned into play, and some play that can be turned
into work? Cannot the powers of observation be
called out in a child while collecting flowers, or
stones, or butterflies? Cannot his judgment be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
strengthened either in gymnastic exercises, or in
measuring the area of a field or the height of a
tower? Might not all this be done without a view
to examinations or payment by results, simply for
the sake of filling the little dull minds with one sunbeam
of joy, such sunbeams being more likely hereafter
to call hidden precious germs into life than the
deadening weight of such lessons as, for instance,
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">th-ough</span></span> is though,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thr-ough</span></span> is through, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">en-ough</span></span>
is enough. A child who believes that will hereafter
believe anything. Those who wish to see Natural
Science introduced into elementary schools frighten
school-masters by the very name of Natural Science.
But surely every school-master who is worth his salt
should be able to teach children a love of Nature, a
wondering at Nature, a curiosity to pry into the secrets
of Nature, an acquisitiveness for some of the
treasures of Nature, and all this acquired in the fresh
air of the field and the forest, where, better than in
frowzy lecture-rooms, the edge of the senses can be
sharpened, the chest widened, and that freedom of
thought fostered which made England what it was
even before the days of compulsory education.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in addressing you here to-night, it was my intention
to speak of higher rather than of elementary
education.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All education—as it now exists in most countries
of Europe—may be divided into three
stages—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">elementary</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scholastic</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">academical</span></span>;
or call it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">primary</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">secondary</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tertiary</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Elementary education has at last been made compulsory
in most civilized countries. Unfortunately,
however, it seems impossible to include under compulsory
education anything beyond the very elements
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of knowledge—at least for the present; though I
know from experience that, with proper management,
a well-conducted elementary school can afford to provide
instruction in extra subjects—such as natural
science, modern languages, and political economy—and
yet, with the present system of government
grants, be self-supporting.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next stage above the elementary is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scholastic</span></span>
education, as it is supplied in grammar schools,
whether public or private. According as the pupils
are intended either to go on to a university, or to
enter at once on leaving school on the practical work
of life, these schools are divided into two classes.
In the one class, which in Germany are called
<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Realschulen</span></span>,
less Latin is taught, and no Greek, but more
of mathematics, modern languages, and physical science;
in the other, called <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Gymnasia</span></span>
on the Continent,
classics form the chief staple of instruction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is during this stage that education, whether at
private or public schools, exercises its strongest levelling
influence. Little attention can be paid at large
schools to individual tastes or talents. In Germany—even
more, perhaps, than in England—it is the
chief object of a good and conscientious master to
have his class as uniform as possible at the end of the
year; and he receives far more credit from the official
examiner if his whole class marches well and keeps
pace together, than if he can parade a few brilliant
and forward boys, followed by a number of straggling
laggards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And as to the character of the teaching at school,
how can it be otherwise than authoritative or dogmatic?
The Sokratic method is very good if we can
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
find the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">viri Socratici</span></span>
and leisure for discussion. But
at school, which now may seem to be called almost in
mockery σχολή, or leisure, the true method is, after
all, that patronized by the great educators of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Boys at school
must turn their mind into a row of pigeon-holes, filling
as many as they can with useful notes, and never
forgetting how many are empty. There is an immense
amount of positive knowledge to be acquired
between the ages of ten and eighteen—rules of grammar,
strings of vocables, dates, names of towns, rivers,
and mountains, mathematical formulas, etc. All depends
here on the receptive and retentive powers of
the mind. The memory has to be strengthened, without
being overtaxed, till it acts almost mechanically.
Learning by heart, I believe, cannot be too assiduously
practised during the years spent at school.
There may have been too much of it when, as the
Rev. H. C. Adams informs us in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Wykehamica”</span>
(p. 357), boys used to say by heart 13,000 and 14,000
lines, when one repeated the whole of Virgil, nay,
when another was able to say the whole of the English
Bible by rote: <span class="tei tei-q">“Put him on where you would,
he would go fluently on, as long as any one would
listen.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No intellectual investment, I feel certain, bears
such ample and such regular interest as gems of English,
Latin, or Greek literature deposited in the memory
during childhood and youth, and taken up from
time to time in the happy hours of solitude.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One fault I have to find with most schools, both in
England and on the Continent. Boys do not read
enough of the Greek and Roman classics. The majority
of our masters are scholars by profession, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they are apt to lay undue stress on what they call
accurate and minute scholarship, and to neglect wide
and cursory reading. I know the arguments for
minute accuracy, but I also know the mischief that is
done by an exclusive devotion to critical scholarship
before we have acquired a real familiarity with the
principal works of classical literature. The time spent
in our schools in learning the rules of grammar and
syntax, writing exercises, and composing verses, is too
large. Look only at our Greek and Latin grammars,
with all their rules and exceptions, and exceptions on
exceptions! It is too heavy a weight for any boy to
carry; and no wonder that when one of the thousand
small rules which they have learnt by heart is really
wanted, it is seldom forthcoming. The end of classical
teaching at school should be to make our boys
acquainted, not only with the language, but with the
literature and history, the ancient thought of the ancient
world. Rules of grammar, syntax, or metre,
are but means towards that end; they must never be
mistaken for the end itself. A young man of eighteen,
who has probably spent on an average ten years
in learning Greek and Latin, ought to be able to read
any of the ordinary Greek or Latin classics without
much difficulty; nay, with a certain amount of pleasure.
He might have to consult his dictionary now
and then, or guess the meaning of certain words; he
might also feel doubtful sometime whether certain
forms came from ἵημι, I send, or εἶμι, I go, or εἰμί, I
am, particularly if preceded by prepositions. In
these matters the best scholars are least inclined to
be pharisaical; and whenever I meet in the controversies
of classical scholars the favorite phrase,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Every school-boy knows, or ought to know, this,”</span> I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
generally say to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“No, he ought not.”</span> Anyhow,
those who wish to see the study of Greek and
Latin retained in our public schools ought to feel convinced
that it will certainly not be retained much
longer, if it can be said with any truth that young
men who leave school at eighteen are in many cases
unable to read or to enjoy a classical text, unless they
have seen it before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Classical teaching, and all purely scholastic teaching,
ought to be finished at school. When a young
man goes to a University, unless he means to make
scholarship his profession, he ought to be free to enter
upon a new career. If he has not learnt by that time
so much of Greek and Latin as is absolutely necessary
in after-life for a lawyer, or a student of physical science,
or even a clergyman, either he or his school is
to blame. I do not mean to say that it would not be
most desirable for every one during his University
career to attend some lectures on classical literature,
on ancient history, philosophy, or art. What is to be
deprecated is, that the University should have to do
the work which belongs properly to the school.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The best colleges at Oxford and Cambridge have
shown by their matriculation examinations what the
standard of classical knowledge ought to be at eighteen
or nineteen. That standard can be reached by
boys while still at school, as has been proved both by
the so-called local examinations, and by the examinations
of schools held under the Delegates appointed
by the Universities. If, therefore, the University
would reassert her old right, and make the first examination,
called at Oxford Responsions, a general
matriculation examination for admission to the University,
not only would the public schools be stimulated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to greater efforts, but the teaching of the University
might assume, from the very beginning, that
academic character which ought to distinguish it from
mere school-boy work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Academic teaching ought to be not merely a continuation,
but in one sense a correction of scholastic
teaching. While at school instruction must be chiefly
dogmatic, at the University is it to be Sokratic? for
I find no better name for that method which is to set
a man free from the burden of purely traditional
knowledge; to make him feel that the words which
he uses are often empty, that the concepts he employs
are, for the most part, mere bundles picked
up at random; that even where he knows facts he
does not know the evidence for them; and where he
expresses opinions, they are mostly mere dogmas,
adopted by him without examination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But for the Universities, I should indeed fear that
Mill's prophecies might come true, and that the intellect
of Europe might drift into dreary monotony.
The Universities always have been, and, unless they
are diverted from their original purpose, always will
be, the guardians of the freedom of thought, the protectors
of individual spontaneity; and it was owing,
I believe, to Mill's want of acquaintance with true
academic teaching that he took so desponding a view
of the generation growing up under his eyes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we leave school, our heads are naturally
brimful of dogma—that is, of knowledge and opinions
at second-hand. Such dead knowledge is extremely
dangerous, unless it is sooner or later revived by the
spirit of free inquiry. It does not matter whether
our scholastic dogmas be true or false. The danger
is the same. And why? Because to place either
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
truth or error above the reach of argument is certain
to weaken truth and to strengthen error. Secondly,
because to hold as true on the authority of others
anything which concerns us deeply, and which we
could prove ourselves, produces feebleness, if not dishonesty.
And, thirdly, because to feel unwilling or
unable to meet objections by argument is generally
the first step towards violence and persecution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not think of religious dogmas only. They
are generally the first to rouse inquiry, even during
our school-boy days, and they are by no means the
most difficult to deal with. Dogma often rages
where we least expect it. Among scientific men the
theory of evolution is at present becoming, or has
become, a dogma. What is the result? No objections
are listened to, no difficulties recognized, and a
man like Virchow, himself the strongest supporter of
evolution, who has the moral courage to say that the
descent of man from any ape whatsoever is, as yet,
before the tribunal of scientific zoölogy, <span class="tei tei-q">“not proven,”</span>
is howled down in Germany in a manner worthy of
Ephesians and Galatians. But at present I am
thinking not so much of any special dogmas, but
rather of that dogmatic state of mind which is the
almost inevitable result of the teaching at school. I
think of the whole intellect, what has been called
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">intellectus
sibi permissus</span></span>, and I maintain it is the
object of academic teaching to rouse that intellect
out of its slumber by questions not less startling than
when Galileo asked the world whether the sun was
really moving and the earth stood still; or when
Kant asked whether time and space were objects, or
necessary forms of our sensuous intuition. Till our
opinions have thus been tested and stood the test,
we can hardly call them our own.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How true this is with regard to religion has been
boldly expressed by Bishop Beveridge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Being conscious to myself,”</span> he writes in his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Private Thoughts on Religion,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“how great an ascendant
Christianity holds over me beyond the rest,
as being that religion whereinto I was born and baptized;
that which the supreme authority has enjoined
and my parents educated me in; that which every
one I meet withal highly approves of, and which I
myself have, by a long-continued profession, made almost
natural to me: I am resolved to be more jealous
and suspicious of this religion than of the rest, and be
sure not to entertain it any longer without being
convinced, by solid and substantial arguments, of the
truth and certainty of it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is bold and manly language from a Bishop,
nearly two hundred years ago, and I certainly think
that the time has come when some of the divinity
lecturers at Oxford and Cambridge might well be
employed in placing a knowledge of the sacred books
of other religions within the reach of undergraduates.
Many of the difficulties—most of them of our own
making—with regard to the origin, the handing
down, the later corruptions and misinterpretations
of sacred texts, would find their natural solution, if
it was shown how exactly the same difficulties arose
and had to be dealt with by theologians of other
creeds. If some—aye, if many—of the doctrines of
Christianity were met with in other religions also,
surely that would not affect their value, or diminish
their truth; while nothing, I feel certain, would
more effectually secure to the pure and simple teaching
of Christ its true place in the historical development
of the human mind than to place it side by side
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the other religions of the world. In the series
of translations of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sacred Books of the East,”</span> of which the first
three volumes have just appeared,<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> I
wished myself to include a new translation of the
Old and New Testaments; and when that series is
finished it will, I believe, be admitted that nowhere
would these two books have had a grander setting,
or have shone with a brighter light, than surrounded
by the Veda, the Zendavesta, the Buddhist Tripi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></span>aka,
and the Qurân.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But as I said before, I was not thinking of religious
dogmas only, or even chiefly, when I maintained
that the character of academic teaching must
be Sokratic, not dogmatic. The evil of dogmatic
teaching lies much deeper, and spreads much farther.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Think only of language, the work of other people,
not of ourselves, which we pick up at random in our
race through life. Does not every word we use require
careful examination and revision? It is not
enough to say that language assists our thoughts or
colors them, or possibly obscures them. No language
and thought are indivisible. It was not from poverty
of expression that the Greeks called reason and
language by the same word, λόγος. It was because
they knew that, though we may distinguish between
thought and speech, as we distinguish between force
and function, it is as impossible to tear the one by
violence away from the other as it is to separate the
concave side of a lens from its convex side. This is
something to learn and to understand, for, if, properly
understood, will it supply the key to most of our
intellectual puzzles, and serve as the safest thread
through the whole labyrinth of philosophy.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is evident,”</span> as Hobbes remarks,<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“that truth
and falsity have no place but amongst such living
creatures as use speech. For though some brute
creatures, looking upon the image of a man in a glass,
may be affected with it, as if it were the man himself,
and for this reason fear it or fawn upon it in
vain; yet they do not apprehend it as true or false,
but only as like; and in this they are not deceived.
Wherefore, as men owe all their true ratiocination
to the right understanding of speech, so also they
owe their errors to the misunderstanding of the same;
and as all the ornaments of philosophy proceed only
from man, so from man also is derived the ugly absurdity
of false opinion. For speech has something
in it like to a spider's web (as it was said of old of
Solon's laws), for by contexture of words tender and
delicate wits are ensnared or stopped, but strong wits
break easily through them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let me illustrate my meaning by at least one instance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the words which have proved spider's webs,
ensnaring even the greatest intellects of the world
from Aristotle down to Leibniz, the terms <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">individual</span></span>
occupy a very prominent place.
The opposition of Aristotle to Plato, of the Nominalists
to the Realists, of Leibniz to Locke, of Herbart
to Hegel, turns on the true meaning of these
words. At school, of course, all we can do is to teach
the received meaning of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>; and if a
boy can trace these terms back to Aristotle's γένος and
εἶδος, and show in what sense that philosopher used
them, every examiner would be satisfied.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the time comes when we have to act as our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
own examiners, and when we have to give an account
to ourselves of such words as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>.
Some people write, indeed, as if they had seen a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span> and a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span>
walking about in broad daylight;
but a little consideration will show us that these
words express subjective concepts, and that, if the
whole world were silent, there would never have been
a thought of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span> or a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>. There are languages
in which we look in vain for corresponding
words; and if we had been born in the atmosphere
of such a language, these terms and thoughts would
not exist for us. They came to us, directly or indirectly,
from Aristotle. But Aristotle did not invent
them, he only defined them in his own way, so that,
for instance, according to him, all living beings would
constitute a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span>, men a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>, and Sokrates an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">individual</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No one would say that Aristotle had not a perfect
right to define these terms, if those who use them in
his sense would only always remember that they are
thinking the thoughts of Aristotle, and not their
own. The true way to shake off the fetters of old
words, and to learn to think our own thoughts, is to
follow them up from century to century, to watch
their development, and in the end to bring ourselves
face to face with those who first found and framed
both words and thoughts. If we do this with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>, we shall find that the words which Aristotle
defined—viz., γένος and εἶδος—had originally
a very different and far more useful application than
that which he gave to them. γένος, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span>, meant generation,
and comprehended such living beings only as
were believed to have a common origin, however they
might differ in outward appearance, as, for instance,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the spaniel and the bloodhound, or, according to Darwin,
the ape and the man. εἶδος, or species, on the
contrary, meant appearance, and comprehended all
such things as had the same form or appearance,
whether they had a common origin or not, as if we
were to speak of a species of four-footed, two-footed,
horned, winged, or blue animals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That two such concepts, as we have here explained,
had a natural justification we may best learn from the
fact that exactly the same thoughts found expression
in Sanskrit. There, too, we find <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>âti, generation,
used in the sense of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus,</span></span> and opposed to
âk<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ri</span></span>ti,
appearance, used in the sense of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So long as these two words or thoughts were used
independently (much as we now speak of a genealogical
as independent of a morphological classification)
no harm could accrue. A family, for instance,
might be called a γένος, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gens</span></span> or clan was a γένος,
the nation (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gnatio</span></span>) was a γένος, the whole human
kith and kin was a γένος; in fact, all that was descended
from common ancestors was a true γένος.
There is no obscurity of thought in this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other side, taking εἶδος or species in its original
sense, one man might be said to be like another
in his εἶδος or appearance. An ape, too, might quite
truly be said to have the same εἶδος or species or appearance
as a man, without any prejudice as to their
common origin. People might also speak of different
εἴδη or forms or classes of things, such as different
kinds of metals, or tools, or armor, without committing
themselves in the least to any opinion as to their
common descent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Often it would happen that things belonging to
the same εἶδος, such as the white man and the negro,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
differed in their εἶδος or appearance; often also that
things belonged to the same εἶδος, such as eatables,
differed in their γένος, as, for instance, meat and vegetables.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this is clear and simple. The confusion began
when these two terms, instead of being coördinate,
were subordinated to each other by the philosophers
of Greece, so that what from one point of view was
called a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span>, might from another be called a species,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>. Human beings, for instance,
were now called a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>,
all living beings a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span>,
which may be true in logic, but is utterly false in
what is older than logic—viz., language, thought, or
fact. According to language, according to reason,
and according to nature, all human beings constitute
a γένος, or generation, so long as they are supposed to
have common ancestors; but with regard to all living
beings we can only say that they form an εἶδος—that
is, agree in certain appearances, until it has
been proved that even Mr. Darwin was too modest
in admitting at least four or five different ancestors
for the whole animal world.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In tracing the history of these two words, γένος and
εἶδος, you may see passing before your eyes almost the
whole panorama of philosophy, from Plato's "ideas"
down to Hegel's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Idee</span></span>.
The question of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genera</span></span>, their
origin and subdivision, occupied chiefly the attention
of natural philosophers, who, after long controversies
about the origin and classification of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genera</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>,
seem at last, thanks to the clear sight of Darwin,
to have arrived at the old truth which was prefigured
in language—namely, that Nature knows nothing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genera</span></span>, or generations, to be traced back to a limited
number of ancestors, and that the so-called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>
are only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genera</span></span>, whose genealogical descent is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as
yet</span></span> more or less obscure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the question as to the nature of the εἶδος became
a vital question in every system of philosophy.
Granting, for instance, that women in every clime
and country formed one species, it was soon asked
what constituted a species? If all women shared a
common form, what was that form? Where was it?
So long as it was supposed that all women descended
from Eve, the difficulty might be slurred over by the
name of heredity. But the more thoughtful would
ask even then how it was that, while all individual
women came and went and vanished, the form in
which they were cast remained the same?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here you see how philosophical mythology springs
up. The very question what εἶδος or species or form
was, and where these things were kept, changed those
words from predicates into subjects. εἶδος was conceived
as something independent and substantial,
something within or above the individuals participating
in it, something unchangeable and eternal. Soon
there arose as many εἴδη or forms or types as there
were general concepts. They were considered the
only true realities of which the phenomenal world is
only as a shadow that soon passeth away. Here we
have, in fact, the origin of Plato's ideas, and of the
various systems of idealism which followed his lead,
while the opposite opinion that ideas have no independent
existence, and that the one is nowhere found
except in the many (τὸ ἕν παρὰ τὰ πολλά), was strenuously
defended by Aristotle and his followers.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same red thread runs through the whole philosophy
of the Middle Ages. Men were cited before
councils and condemned as heretics because they declared
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">animal</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">woman</span></span> were mere names,
and that they could not bring themselves to believe
in an ideal animal, an ideal man, an ideal woman as
the invisible, supernatural, or metaphysical types of
the ordinary animal, the individual man, the single
woman. Those philosophers, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nominalists</span></span>, in
opposition to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Realists</span></span>, declared that all general
terms were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">names only</span></em>, and that nothing could claim
reality but the individual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We cannot follow this controversy farther, as it
turns up again between Locke and Leibniz, between
Herbart and Hegel. Suffice it to say that the knot,
as it was tied by language, can be untied by the science
of language alone, which teaches us that there
is and can be no such thing as <span class="tei tei-q">“a name only.”</span> That
phrase ought to be banished from all works on philosophy.
A name is and always has been the subjective
side of our knowledge, but that subjective side is as
impossible without an objective side as a key is without
a lock. It is useless to ask which of the two is
the more real, for they are real only by being, not
two, but one. Realism is as one-sided as Nominalism.
But there is a higher Nominalism, which might better
be called the Science of Language, and which
teaches us that, apart from sensuous perception, all
human knowledge is by names and by names only,
and that the object of names is always the general.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is but one out of hundreds and thousands of
cases to show how names and concepts which come
to us by tradition must be submitted to very careful
snuffing before they will yield a pure light. What I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mean by academic teaching and academic study is
exactly this process of snuffing, this changing of traditional
words into living words, this tracing of modern
thought back to ancient primitive thought, this
living, as it were, once more, so far as it concerns
us, the whole history of human thought ourselves,
till we are as little afraid to differ from Plato or
Aristotle as from Comte or Darwin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Plato and Aristotle are, no doubt, great names;
every school-boy is awed by them, even though he
may have read very little of their writings. This,
too, is a kind of dogmatism that requires correction.
Now, at his University, a young student might chance
to hear the following, by no means respectful, remarks
about Aristotle, which I copy from one of the
greatest English scholars and philosophers: <span class="tei tei-q">“There
is nothing so absurd that the old philosophers, as
Cicero saith, who was one of them, have not some
of them maintained; and I believe that scarce anything
can be more absurdly said in natural philosophy
than that which now is called Aristotle's Metaphysics;
or more repugnant to government than much of
that he hath said in his Politics; nor more ignorantly
than a great part of his Ethics.”</span> I am far from approving
this judgment, but I think that the shock
which a young scholar receives on seeing his idols so
mercilessly broken is salutary. It throws him back
on his own resources; it makes him honest to himself.
If he thinks the criticism thus passed on Aristotle
unfair, he will begin to read his works with new
eyes. He will not only construe his words, but try
to reconstruct in his own mind the thoughts so carefully
elaborated by that ancient philosopher. He
will judge of their truth without being swayed by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the authority of a great name, and probably in the
end value what is valuable in Aristotle, or Plato, or
any other great philosopher far more highly and honestly
than if he had never seen them trodden under
foot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Do not suppose that I look upon the Universities
as purely iconoclastic, as chiefly intended to teach us
how to break the idols of the schools. Far from it!
But I do look upon them as meant to supply a fresher
atmosphere than we breathed at school, and to shake
our mind to its very roots, as a storm shakes the
young oaks, not to throw them down, but to make
them grasp all the more firmly the hard soil of fact
and truth! <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stand upright on thy feet</span></span>”</span> ought to
be written over the gate of every college, if the epidemic
of uniformity and sequacity which Mill saw
approaching from China, and which since his time
has made such rapid progress Westward, is ever to
be stayed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Academic freedom is not without its dangers; but
there are dangers which it is safer to face than to
avoid. In Germany—so far as my own experience
goes—students are often left too much to themselves,
and it is only the cleverest among them, or those who
are personally recommended, who receive from the
professors that individual guidance and encouragement
which should and could be easily extended to
all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is too much time spent in the German Universities
in mere lecturing, and often in simply retailing
to a class what each student might read in
books in a far more perfect form. Lectures are useful
if they teach us how to teach ourselves; if they
stimulate; if they excite sympathy and curiosity; if
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they give advice that springs from personal experience;
if they warn against wrong roads; if, in fact,
they have less the character of a show-window than
of a workshop. Half an hour's conversation with a
tutor or a professor often does more than a whole
course of lectures in giving the right direction and
the right spirit to a young man's studies. Here I
may quote the words of Professor Helmholtz, in full
agreement with him. <span class="tei tei-q">“When I recall the memory
of my own University life,”</span> he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“and the impression
which a man like Johannes Müller, the professor
of physiology, made on us, I must set the
highest value on the personal intercourse with teachers
from whom one learns how thought works in independent
heads. Whoever has come in contact but
once with one or several first-class men will find his
intellectual standard changed for life.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In English Universities, on the contrary, there is
too little of academic freedom. There is not only
guidance, but far too much of constant personal control.
It is often thought that English undergraduates
could not be trusted with that amount of academic
freedom which is granted to German students, and
that most of them, if left to choose their own work,
their own time, their own books, and their own teachers,
would simply do nothing. This seems to me unfair
and untrue. Most horses, if you take them to
the water, will drink; and the best way to make
them drink is to leave them alone. I have lived long
enough in English and in German Universities to
know that the intellectual fibre is as strong and sound
in the English as in the German youth. But if you
supply a man, who wishes to learn swimming, with
bladders—nay, if you insist on his using them—he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will use them, but he will probably never learn to
swim. Take them away, on the contrary, and depend
on it, after a few aimless strokes and a few painful
gulps, he will use his arms and his legs, and he
will swim. If young men do not learn to use their
arms, their legs, their muscles, their senses, their
brain, and their heart too, during the bright years of
their University life, when are they to learn it?
True, there are thousands who never learn it, and
who float happily on through life buoyed up on mere
bladders. The worst that can happen to them is that
some day the bladders may burst, and they may be
left stranded or drowned. But these are not the men
whom England wants to fight her battles. It has
often been pointed out of late that many of those who
during this century have borne the brunt of the battle
in the intellectual warfare in England, have not
been trained at our Universities, while others who
have been at Oxford and Cambridge, and have distinguished
themselves in after life, have openly declared
that they attended hardly any lectures in college, or
that they derived no benefit from them. What can
be the ground of that? Not that there is less work
done at Oxford than at Leipzig, but that the work
is done in a different spirit. It is free in Germany;
it has now become almost compulsory in England.
Though an old professor myself, I like to attend,
when I can, some of the professorial lectures in
Germany; for it is a real pleasure to see hundreds
of young faces listening to a teacher on the history of
art, on modern history, on the science of language, or
on philosophy, without any view to examinations,
simply from love of the subject or of the teacher. No
one who knows what the real joy of learning is, how it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lightens all drudgery and draws away the mind from
mean pursuits, can see without indignation that what
ought to be the freest and happiest years in a man's
life should often be spent between cramming and examinations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And here I have at last mentioned the word, which
to many friends of academic freedom, to many who
dread the baneful increase of uniformity, may seem
the cause of all mischief, the most powerful engine
for intellectual levelling—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Examination</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a strong feeling springing up everywhere
against the tyranny of examinations, against the
cramping and withering influence which they are
supposed to exercise on the youth of England. I
cannot join in that outcry. I well remember that
the first letters which I ventured to address to the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Times</span></span>, in very imperfect English, were in favor of
examinations. They were signed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La Carrière ouverte</span></span>,
and were written before the days of the Civil Service
Commission! I well remember, too, that the first
time I ventured to speak, or rather to stammer, in
public, was in favor of examinations. That was in
1857, at Exeter, when the first experiment was made,
under the auspices of Sir T. Acland, in the direction
of what has since developed into the Oxford and
Cambridge Local Examinations. I have been an examiner
myself for many years, I have watched the
growth of that system in England from year to year,
and, in spite of all that has been said and written of
late against it, I confess I do not see how it would be
possible to abolish it, and return to the old system of
appointment by patronage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But though I have not lost my faith in examinations,
I cannot conceal the fact that I am frightened
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the manner in which they are conducted, and by
the results which they produce. As you are interested
yourselves at this Midland Institute in the successful
working of examinations, you will perhaps
allow me in conclusion to add a few remarks on the
safeguards necessary for the efficient working of examinations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All examinations are a means to ascertain how
pupils have been taught; they ought never to be
allowed to become the end for which pupils are
taught. Teaching with a view to them lowers the
teacher in the eyes of his pupils; learning with a
view to them is apt to produce shallowness and dishonesty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whatever attractions learning possesses in itself,
and whatever efforts were formerly made by boys at
school from a sense of duty, all this is lost if they
once imagine that the highest object of all learning is
to gain marks in a competition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In order to maintain the proper relation between
teacher and pupil, all pupils should be made to look
to their teachers as their natural examiners and fairest
judges, and therefore in every examination the report
of the teacher ought to carry the greatest weight.
This is the principle followed abroad in examining
candidates at public schools; and even in their examination
on leaving school, which gives them the right
to enter the University, they know that their success
depends far more on the work which they have done
during the years at school, than on the work done on
the few days of their examination. There are outside
examiners appointed by Government to check the
work done at schools and during the examinations;
but the cases in which they have to modify or reverse
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the award of the master are extremely rare, and they
are felt to reflect seriously on the competency or impartiality
of the school authorities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To leave examinations entirely to strangers reduces
them to the level of lotteries, and fosters a cleverness
in teachers and taught often akin to dishonesty. An
examiner may find out what a candidate knows <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>,
he can hardly ever find out all he knows; and even if
he succeeds in finding out <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how much</span></em> a candidate
knows, he can seldom find out <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> he knows it. On
these points the opinion of the masters who have
watched their pupils for years is indispensable for the
sake of the examiner, for the sake of the pupils, and
for the sake of their teachers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know I shall be told that it would be impossible
to trust the masters, and to be guided by their opinion,
because they are interested parties. Now, first
of all, there are far more honest men in the world
than dishonest, and it does not answer to legislate as
if all school-masters were rogues. It is enough that
they should know that their reports would be scrutinized,
to keep even the most reprobate of teachers
from bearing false witness in favor of their pupils.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, I believe that unnecessary temptation is
now being placed before all parties concerned in examinations.
The proper reward for a good examination
should be honor, not pounds, shillings, and pence.
The mischief done by pecuniary rewards offered in
the shape of scholarships and exhibitions at school
and University, begins to be recognized very widely.
To train a boy of twelve for a race against all England
is generally to overstrain his faculties, and often
to impair his usefulness in later life; but to make
him feel that by his failure he will entail on his father
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the loss of a hundred a year, and on his teacher
the loss of pupils, is simply cruel at that early age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is said that these scholarships and exhibitions
enable the sons of poor parents to enjoy the privilege
of the best education in England, from which they
would otherwise be debarred by the excessive costliness
of our public schools. But even this argument,
strong as it seems, can hardly stand, for I believe it
could be shown that the majority of those who are
successful in obtaining scholarships and exhibitions
at school or at the University are boys whose parents
have been able to pay the highest price for their children's
previous education. If all these prizes were
abolished, and the funds thus set free used to lessen
the price of education at school and in college, I believe
that the sons of poor parents would be far more
benefited than by the present system. It might also
be desirable to lower the school fees in the case of the
sons of poor parents, who were doing well at school
from year to year; and, in order to guard against
favoritism, an examination, particularly
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vivâ voce</span></span>, before
all the masters of a school, possibly even with
some outside examiner, might be useful. But the
present system bids fair to degenerate into mere
horse-racing, and I shall not wonder if, sooner or
later, the two-year olds entered for the race have to
be watched by their trainer that they may not be
overfed or drugged against the day of the race. It
has come to this, that schools are bidding for clever
boys in order to run them in the races, and in France,
I read, that parents actually extort money from
schools by threatening to take away the young racers
that are likely to win the Derby.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we turn from the schools to the Universities we
find here, too, the same complaints against over-examination.
Now it seems to me that every University,
in order to maintain its position, has a perfect
right to demand two examinations, but no more: one
for admission, the other for a degree. Various attempts
have been made in Germany, in Russia, in
France, and in England to change and improve the
old academic tradition, but in the end the original,
and, as it would seem, the natural system, has generally
proved its wisdom and reasserted its right.

If a University surrenders the right of examining
those who wish to be admitted, the tutors will often
have to do the work of school-masters, and the professors
can never know how high or how low they should
aim in their public lectures; and the result will be a
lowering of the standard at the Universities, and consequently
at the public schools. Some Universities,
on the contrary, like over-anxious mothers, have multiplied
examinations so as to make quite sure, at the
end of each term or each year, that the pupils confided
to them have done at least some work. This
kind of forced labor may do some good to the incorrigibly
idle, but it does the greatest harm to all the
rest. If there is an examination at the end of each
year, there can be no freedom left for any independent
work. Both teachers and taught will be guided
by the same pole-star—examinations; no deviation
from the beaten track will be considered safe, and all
the pleasure derived from work done for its own sake,
and all the just pride and joy, which those only know
who have ever ventured out by themselves on the
open sea of knowledge, must be lost.

It is certainly marvellous what an amount of
knowledge candidates will produce before their examiners;
but those who have been both examined
and examiners know best how fleeting that knowledge
often is, and how different from that other
knowledge which has been acquired slowly and
quietly, for its own sake, for our own sake, without
a thought as to whether it would ever pay at examinations
or not. A candidate, after giving most glibly
the dates and the titles of the principal works of
Cobbett, Gibbon, Burke, Adam Smith, and David
Hume, was asked whether he had ever seen any of
their writings, and he had to answer, No. Another
who was asked which of the works of Pheidias he
had seen, replied that he had only read the first two
books. This is the kind of dishonest knowledge
which is fostered by too frequent examinations.
There are two kinds of knowledge, the one that
enters into our very blood, the other which we carry
about in our pockets. Those who read for examinations
have generally their pockets cram full; those
who work on quietly and have their whole heart in
their work are often discouraged at the small amount
of their knowledge, at the little life-blood they have
made. But what they have learnt has really become
their own, has invigorated their whole frame, and in
the end they have often proved the strongest and
happiest men in the battle of life.

Omniscience is at present the bane of all our
knowledge. From the day he leaves school and
enters the University a man ought to make up his
mind that in many things he must either remain
altogether ignorant, or be satisfied with knowledge
at second-hand. Thus only can he clear the decks
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for action. And the sooner he finds out what his
own work is to be, the more useful and delightful
will be his life at the University and later. There
are few men who have a passion for all knowledge;
there is hardly one who has not a hobby of his own.
Those so-called hobbies ought to be utilized, and not,
as they are now, discouraged, if we wish our Universities
to produce more men like Faraday, Carlyle,
Grote, or Darwin. I do not say that in an examination
for a University degree a minimum of what is
now called general culture should not be insisted on;
but in addition to that, far more freedom ought to
be given to the examiner to let each candidate produce
his own individual work. This is done to a far
greater extent in Continental than in English Universities,
and the examinations are therefore mostly
confided to the members of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Senatus Academicus</span></span>,
consisting of the most experienced teachers, and the
most eminent representatives of the different branches
of knowledge in the University. Their object is not
to find out how many marks each candidate may
gain by answering a larger or smaller number of
questions, and then to place them in order before
the world like so many organ pipes. They want to
find out whether a man, by the work he has done
during his three or four University years, has acquired
that vigor of thought, that maturity of judgment,
and that special knowledge, which fairly entitle
him to an academic degree, with or without special
honors. Such a degree confers no material advantages;<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a>
it does not entitle its holder to any employment
in Church or State; it does not vouch even for
his being a fit person to be made an Archbishop or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Prime Minister. All this is left to the later struggle
for life; and in that struggle it seems as if those who,
after having surveyed the vast field of human knowledge,
have settled on a few acres of their own and
cultivated them as they were never cultivated before,
who have worked hard and have tasted the true joy
and happiness of hard work, who have gladly listened
to others, but always depended on themselves,
were, after all, the men whom great nations delighted
to follow as their royal leaders in the onward
march towards greater enlightenment, greater happiness,
and greater freedom.

To sum up, no one can read Mill's Essay <span class="tei tei-q">“On
Liberty”</span> at the present moment without feeling that
even during the short period of the last twenty years
the cause which he advocated so strongly and passionately,
the cause of individual freedom, has made
rapid progress—aye, has carried the day. In no
country <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em> a man be so entirely himself, so true to
himself, and yet loyal to society, as in England.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, although the enemy whose encroachments
Mill feared most and resented most has been driven
back and forced to keep within his own bounds—though
such names as Dissenter and Nonconformist,
which were formerly used in society as fatal darts,
seem to have lost all the poison which they once contained—Mill's
principal fears have nevertheless not
been belied, and the blight of uniformity which he
saw approaching with its attendant evils of feebleness,
indifference, and sequacity, has been spreading
more widely than ever.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has ever been maintained that the very freedom
which every individual now enjoys has been
detrimental to the growth of individuality; that you
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must have an Inquisition if you want to see martyrs,
that you must have despotism and tyranny to call
forth heroes. The very measures which the friends
of individual development advocated so warmly, compulsory
education and competitive examinations, are
pointed out as having chiefly contributed to produce
that large array of pass-men, that dead level of uninteresting
excellence, which is the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">beau

Chinese Mandarin, while it frightened and disheartened
such men as Humboldt, Tocqueville, and John
Stuart Mill himself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There may be some truth in all this, but it is certainly
not the whole truth. Education, as it has to
be carried on, whether in elementary or in public
schools, is no doubt a heavy weight which might
well press down the most independent spirit; it is,
in fact, neither more nor less than placing, in a systematized
form, on the shoulders of every generation
the ever-increasing mass of knowledge, experience,
custom, and tradition that has been accumulated by
former generations. We need not wonder, therefore,
if in some schools all spring, all vigor, all joyousness
of work is crushed out under that load of names
and dates, of anomalous verbs and syntactic rules,
of mathematical formulas and geometrical theories
which boys are expected to bring up for competitive
examinations.

But a remedy has been provided, and we are ourselves
to blame if we do not avail ourselves of it to
the fullest extent. Europe erected its Universities,
and called them the homes of the Liberal Arts, and
determined that between the mental slavery of the
school and the physical slavery of busy life every
man should have at least three years of freedom.

What Sokrates and his great pupil Plato had done

to do for the youth of Italy, France, England, Spain,
and Germany; and, though with varying success,
they have done it. The mediæval and modern Universities
have been from century to century the
homes of free thought. Here the most eminent men
have spent their lives, not in retailing traditional
knowledge, as at school, but in extending the frontiers
of science in all directions. Here, in close intercourse
with their teachers, or under their immediate
guidance, generation after generation of boys
fresh from school have grown up into men during
the three years of their academic life. Here, for the
first time, each man has been encouraged to dare to
be himself, to follow his own tastes, to depend on his
own judgment, to try the wings of his mind, and, lo,
like young eagles thrown out of their nest, they
could fly. Here the old knowledge accumulated at
school was tested, and new knowledge acquired
straight from the fountain-head. Here knowledge
ceased to be a mere burden, and became a power invigorating
the whole mind, like snow which during
winter lies cold and heavy on the meadows, but
when it is touched by the sun of spring melts away,
and fertilizes the ground for a rich harvest.

That was the original purpose of the Universities;
and the more they continue to fulfil that purpose,
the more will they secure to us that real freedom
from tradition, from custom, from mere opinion and
superstition, which can be gained by independent
study only; the more will they foster that <span class="tei tei-q">“human
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Humboldt, considered as the highest object of all society.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such academic teaching need not be confined to
the old Universities. There is many a great University
that sprang from smaller beginnings than
your Midland Institute. Nor is it necessary, in order
to secure the real benefits of academic teaching,
to have all the paraphernalia of a University, its colleges
and fellowships, its caps and gowns. What is
really wanted is the presence of men who, having
done good work in their life, are willing to teach
others how to work for themselves, how to think for
themselves, how to judge for themselves. That is
the true academic stage in every man's life, when he
learns to work, not to please others, be they schoolmasters
or examiners, but to please himself, when he
works from sheer love of work, and for the highest
of all purposes, the quest of truth. Those only who
have passed through that stage know the real blessings
of work. To the world at large they may seem
mere drudges—but the world does not know the
triumphant joy with which the true mountaineer,
high above clouds and mountain walls that once
seemed unsurpassable, drinks in the fresh air of the
High Alps, and away from the fumes, the dust, and
the noises of the city, revels alone, in freedom of
thought, in freedom of feeling, and in the freedom of
the highest faith.

A Lecture Delivered At The Royal Institution
In 1871.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What can be in our days the interest of mythology?
What is it to us that Kronos was the son of
Uranos and Gaia, and that he swallowed his children,
Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Pluton, and Poseidon, as soon
as they were born? What have we to do with the
stories of Rhea, the wife of Kronos, who, in order to
save her youngest son from being swallowed by his
father, gave her husband a stone to swallow instead?
And why should we be asked to admire the exploits
of this youngest son, who, when he had grown up,
made his father drink a draught, and thus helped to
deliver the stone and his five brothers and sisters from
their paternal prison? What shall we think if we
read in the most admired of classic poets that these
escaped prisoners became afterwards the great gods
of Greece, gods believed in by Homer, worshipped by
Sokrates, immortalized by Pheidias? Why should
we listen to such horrors as that Tantalos killed his
own son, boiled him, and placed him before the gods
to eat? or that the gods collected his limbs, threw
them into a cauldron, and thus restored Pelops to
life, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">minus</span></em>, however, his shoulder, which Demeter
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had eaten in a fit of absence, and which had therefore
to be replaced by a shoulder made of ivory?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Can we imagine anything more silly, more savage,
more senseless, anything more unworthy to engage
our thoughts, even for a single moment? We may
pity our children that, in order to know how to construe
and understand the master-works of Homer and
Virgil, they have to fill their memory with such idle
tales; but we might justly suppose that men who
have serious work to do in this world would banish
such subjects forever from their thoughts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet, how strange, from the very childhood of
philosophy, from the first faintly-whispered Why? to
our own time of matured thought and fearless inquiry,
mythology has been the ever-recurrent subject
of anxious wonder and careful study. The ancient
philosophers, who could pass by the petrified shells
on mountain-tops and the fossil trees buried in their
quarries without ever asking the question how they
came to be there, or what they signified, were ever
ready with doubts and surmises when they came to
listen to ancient stories of their gods and heroes.
And, more curious still, even modern philosophers
cannot resist the attraction of these ancient problems.
That stream of philosophic thought which, springing
from Descartes (1596-1650), rolled on through the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in two beds—the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idealistic</span></em>, marked by the names of Malebranche
(1638-1715), Spinoza (1632-1677), and Leibniz
(1646-1716); and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensualistic</span></em>, marked by the
names of Locke (1632-1704), David Hume (1711-1776),
and Condillac (1715-1780), till the two arms
united again in Kant (1724-1804), and the full
stream was carried on by Schelling (1775-1854), and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hegel (1770-1831),—this stream of modern philosophic
thought has ended where ancient philosophy
began—in a Philosophy of Mythology, which, as
you know, forms the most important part of Schelling's
final system, of what he called himself his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Positive
Philosophy</span></span>, given to the world after the death
of that great thinker and poet, in the year 1854.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not mean to say that Schelling and Aristotle
looked upon mythology in the same light, or that
they found in it exactly the same problems; yet there
is this common feature in all who have thought or
written on mythology, that they look upon it as
something which, whatever it may mean, does certainly
not mean what it seems to mean; as something
that requires an explanation, whether it be a system
of religion, or a phase in the development of the human
mind, or an inevitable catastrophe in the life of
language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to some, mythology is history changed
into fable; according to others, fable changed into
history. Some discover in it the precepts of moral
philosophy enunciated in the poetical language of antiquity;
others see in it a picture of the great forms
and forces of nature, particularly the sun, the moon,
and the stars, the changes of day and night, the succession
of the seasons, the return of the years—all
this reflected by the vivid imagination of ancient
poets and sages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Epicharmos, for instance, the pupil of Pythagoras,
declared that the gods of Greece were not what, from
the poems of Homer, we might suppose them to be—personal
beings, endowed with superhuman powers,
but liable to many of the passions and frailties of
human nature. He maintained that these gods were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
really the Wind, the Water, the Earth, the Sun, the
Fire, and the Stars. Not long after his time, another
philosopher, Empedokles, holding that the whole of
nature consisted in the mixture and separation of the
four elements, declared that Zeus was the element
of Fire, Here the element of Air, Aidoneus or Pluton
the element of Earth, and Nestis the element of
Water. In fact, whatever the free thinkers of Greece
discovered successively as the first principles of Being
and Thought, whether the air of Anaximenes, or the
fire of Herakleitos, or the Nous or Mind of Anaxagoras,
was readily identified with Zeus and the other
divine persons of Olympian mythology. Metrodoros,
the contemporary of Anaxagoras, went even farther.
While Anaxagoras would have been satisfied with
looking upon Zeus as but another name of his Nous,
the highest intellect, the mover, the disposer, the governor
of all things, Metrodoros resolved not only the
persons of Zeus, Here, and Athene, but likewise those
of human kings and heroes—such as Agamemnon,
Achilles, and Hektor—into various combinations and
physical agencies, and treated the adventures ascribed
to them as natural facts hidden under a thin veil of
allegory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sokrates, it is well known, looked upon such attempts
at explaining all fables allegorically as too
arduous and unprofitable: yet he, too, as well as
Plato, pointed frequently to what they called the
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">hypónoia</span></span>,
the under-current, or, if I may say so, the
under-meaning of ancient mythology.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Aristotle speaks more explicitly:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It has been handed down,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“by early
and very ancient people, and left to those who came
after, in the form of myths, that these (the first principles
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the world) are the gods, and that the divine
embraces the whole of nature. The rest has been
added mythically, in order to persuade the many, and
in order to be used in support of laws and other interests.
Thus they say that the gods have a human
form, and that they are like to some of the other living
beings, and other things consequent on this, and
similar to what has been said. If one separated out
of these fables, and took only that first point, namely,
that they believed the first essences to be gods, one
would think that it had been divinely said, and that
while every art and every philosophy was probably
invented ever so many times and lost again, these
opinions had, like fragments of them, been preserved
until now. So far only is the opinion of our fathers,
and that received from our first ancestors, clear to
us.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have quoted the opinions of these Greek philosophers,
to which many more might have been added,
partly in order to show how many of the most distinguished
minds of ancient Greece agreed in demanding
an interpretation, whether physical or metaphysical,
of Greek mythology, partly in order to satisfy those
classical scholars, who, forgetful of their own classics,
forgetful of their own Plato and Aristotle, seem to
imagine that the idea of seeing in the gods and heroes
of Greece anything beyond what they appear to be
in the songs of Homer, was a mere fancy and invention
of the students of Comparative Mythology.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were, no doubt, Greeks, and eminent Greeks
too, who took the legends of their gods and heroes in
their literal sense. But what do these say of Homer
and Hesiod? Xenophanes, the contemporary of Pythagoras,
holds Homer and Hesiod responsible for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
popular superstitions of Greece. In this he agrees
with Herodotus, when he declares that these two
poets made the theogony for the Greeks, and gave to
the gods their names, and assigned to them their honors
and their arts, and described their appearances.
But he then continues in a very different strain from
the pious historian.<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Homer,”</span> he says,<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“and Hesiod
ascribed to the gods whatever is disgraceful and
scandalous among men, yea, they declared that the
gods had committed nearly all unlawful acts, such as
theft, adultery, and fraud.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Men seem to have
created their gods, and to have given to them their
own mind, voice, and figure. The Ethiopians made
their gods black and flat-nosed; the Thracians red-haired
and blue-eyed.”</span> This was spoken about 500
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span> Herakleitos, about 460 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span>,
one of the boldest thinkers of ancient Greece, declared that Homer
deserved to be ejected from public assemblies and
flogged; and a story is told that Pythagoras (about
540 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span>) saw the soul of Homer in Hades, hanging
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on a tree and surrounded by serpents, as a punishment
for what he had said of the gods. And what
can be stronger than the condemnation passed on
Homer by Plato? I shall read an extract from the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Republic,”</span> from the excellent translation lately
published by Professor Jowett:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But what fault do you find with Homer and
Hesiod, and the other great story-tellers of mankind?”</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“A fault which is most serious,”</span> I said: <span class="tei tei-q">“the fault
of telling a lie, and a bad lie.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

and the sufferings which his son inflicted upon him,
even if they were true, ought not to be lightly told
to young and simple persons; if possible, they had
better be buried in silence. But if there is an absolute
necessity for their mention, a very few might
hear them in a mystery, and then let them sacrifice
not a common (Eleusinian) pig, but some huge and

To those who look upon mythology as an ancient
form of religion, such freedom of language as is here
used by Xenophanes and Plato, must seem startling.
If the Iliad were really the Bible of the Greeks, as it
has not infrequently been called, such violent invectives
would have been impossible. For let us bear
in mind that Xenophanes, though he boldly denied
the existence of all the mythological deities, and
declared his belief in One God, <span class="tei tei-q">“neither in form nor
in thought like unto mortals,”</span><a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> was not therefore
considered a heretic. He never suffered for uttering
his honest convictions: on the contrary, as far as we
know, he was honored by the people among whom he
lived and taught. Nor was Plato ever punished on
account of his unbelief, and though he, as well as his
master, Sokrates, became obnoxious to the dominant
party at Athens, this was due to political far more
than to theological motives. At all events, Plato, the
pupil, the friend, the apologist of Sokrates, was allowed
to teach at Athens to the end of his life, and
few men commanded greater respect in the best ranks
of Greek society.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, although mythology was not religion in our
sense of the word, and although the Iliad certainly
never enjoyed among Greeks the authority either of
the Bible, or even of the Veda among the Brahmans,
or the Zend Avesta among the Parsis, yet I would
not deny altogether that in a certain sense the mythology
of the Greeks belonged to their religion. We
must only be on our guard, here as everywhere else,
against the misleading influence of words. The word
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Religion has, like most words, had its history; it has
grown and changed with each century, and it cannot,
therefore, have meant with the Greeks and Brahmans
what it means with us. Religions have sometimes
been divided into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">national</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">traditional</span></em>, as distinguished
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">statutable</span></em> religion. The
former are, like languages, home-grown, autochthonic,
without an historical beginning, generally without
any recognized founder, or even an authorized code;
the latter have been founded by historical persons,
generally in antagonism to traditional systems, and
they always rest on the authority of a written code.
I do not consider this division as very useful<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> for a
scientific study of religion, because in many cases it
is extremely difficult, and sometimes impossible, to
draw a sharp line of demarcation, and to determine
whether a given religion should be considered as the
work of one man, or as the combined work of those
who came before him, who lived with him, nay, even
of those who came after him. For our present purpose,
however, for showing at once the salient difference
between what the Greeks and what we ourselves
should mean by Religion, this division is very serviceable.
The Greek religion was clearly a national and
traditional religion, and, as such, it shared both the
advantages and disadvantages of this form of religious
belief; the Christian religion is an historical and, to
a great extent, an individual religion, and it possesses
the advantage of an authorized code and of a settled
system of faith. Let it not be supposed, however,
that between traditional and individual religions the
advantages are all on one, the disadvantages on the
other side. As long as the immemorial religions of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the different branches of the human race remained in
their natural state, and were not pressed into the service
of political parties or an ambitious priesthood,
they allowed great freedom of thought and a healthy
growth of real piety, and they were seldom disgraced
by an intolerant or persecuting spirit. They were
generally either honestly believed, or, as we have just
seen, honestly attacked, and a high tone of intellectual
morality was preserved, untainted by hypocrisy,
equivocation, or unreasoning dogmatism. The marvellous
development of philosophy in Greece, particularly
in ancient Greece, was chiefly due, I believe, to
the absence of an established religion and an influential
priesthood; and it is impossible to overrate the
blessing which the fresh, pure, invigorating, and elevating
air of that ancient Greek philosophy has conferred
on all ages, not excepting our own. I shudder
at the thought of what the world would have been
without Plato and Aristotle, and I tremble at the
idea that the youth of the future should ever be deprived
of the teaching and the example of these true
prophets of the absolute freedom of thought. Unfortunately,
we know but little of the earliest fathers
of Greek philosophy; we have but fragments, and
those not always trustworthy, nor easily intelligible,
of what they taught on the highest questions that can
stir the heart of man. We have been accustomed to
call the oracular sayings of men like Thales, Pythagoros,
Xenophanes, or Herakleitos, philosophy, but
there was in them as much of religion as in the songs
of Homer and Hesiod. Homer and Hesiod were
great powers, but their poems were not the only
feeders of the religious life of Greece. The stream
of ancient wisdom and philosophy flowed parallel with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the stream of legend and poetry; and both were meant
to support the religious cravings of the soul. We
have only to attend without prejudice to the utterances
of these ancient prophets, such as Xenophanes
and Herakleitos, in order to convince ourselves that
these men spoke with authority to the people,<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> that
they considered themselves the equals of Homer and
Hesiod, nay, their betters, and in no way fettered by
the popular legends about gods and goddesses. While
modern religions assume in general a hostile attitude
towards philosophy, ancient religions have either included
philosophy as an integral part, or they have
at least tolerated its growth in the very precincts of
their temples.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After we have thus seen what limitations we must
place on the meaning of the word Religion, if we call
mythology the religion of the ancient world, we may
now advance another step.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have glanced at the principal interpretations
which have been proposed by the ancients themselves
of the original purpose and meaning of mythology.
But there is one question which none, either of the
ancient or of the modern interpreters of mythology,
has answered, or even asked, and on which, nevertheless,
the whole problem of mythology seems to turn.
If mythology is history changed into fable, why was
it so changed? If it is fable represented as history,
why were such fables invented? If it contains precepts
of moral philosophy, whence their immoral disguise?
If it is a picture of the great forms and forces
of nature, the same question still returns, why were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these forms and forces represented as heroes and
heroines, as nymphs and shepherds, as gods and
goddesses? It is easy enough to call the sun a god,
or the dawn a goddess, after these predicates have
once been framed. But how were these predicates
framed? How did people come to know of gods and
goddesses, heroes and nymphs, and what meaning did
they originally connect with these terms? In fact,
the real question which a philosophy of mythology
has to answer is this—Is the whole of mythology an
invention, the fanciful poetry of a Homer or Hesiod,
or is it a growth? Or, to speak more definitely, Was
mythology a mere accident, or was it inevitable?
Was it only a false step, or was it a step that could
not have been left out in the historical progress of
the human mind?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The study of the history of language, which is only
a part of the study of the history of thought, has enabled
us to give a decisive answer to this question.
Mythology is inevitable, it is natural, it is an inherent
necessity of language, if we recognize in language
the outward form and manifestation of thought: it
is, in fact, the dark shadow which language throws
on thought, and which can never disappear till language
becomes altogether commensurate with thought,
which it never will. Mythology, no doubt, breaks
out more fiercely during the early periods of the history
of human thought, but it never disappears altogether.
Depend upon it, there is mythology now as
there was in the time of Homer, only we do not perceive
it, because we ourselves live in the very shadow
of it, and because we all shrink from the full meridian
light of truth. We are ready enough to see that if
the ancients called their kings and heroes Διογενεῖς,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sprung of Zeus, that expression, intended originally
to convey the highest praise which man can bestow on
man, was apt to lapse into mythology. We easily
perceive how such a conception, compatible in its
origin with the highest reverence for the gods, led almost
inevitably to the growth of fables, which transferred
to divine beings the incidents of human paternity
and sonship. But we are not so ready to see
that it is our fate, too, to move in allegories which
illustrate things intellectual by visions exhibited to
the fancy. In our religion, too, the conceptions of
paternity and sonship have not always been free from
all that is human, nor are we always aware that
nearly every note that belongs to human paternity
and sonship must be taken out of these terms, before
they can be pronounced safe against mythological infection.
Papal decisions on immaculate conception
are of no avail against that mythology. The mind
must become immaculate and rise superior to itself;
or it must close its eyes and shut its lips in the presence
of the Divine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If then we want to understand mythology, in the
ordinary and restricted sense of the word, we must
discover the larger circle of mental phenomena to
which it belongs. Greek mythology, is but a small
segment of mythology; the religious mythologies of
all the races of mankind are again but a small segment
of mythology. Mythology, in the highest sense,
is the power exercised by language on thought in
every possible sphere of mental activity; and I do
not hesitate to call the whole history of philosophy,
from Thales down to Hegel, an uninterrupted battle
against mythology, a constant protest of thought
against language. This will require some explanation.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ever since the time of Wilhelm von Humboldt, all
who have seriously grappled with the highest problems
of the Science of Language have come to the
conviction that thought and language are inseparable,
that language is as impossible without thought
as thought is without language; that they stand to
each other somewhat like soul and body, like power
and function, like substance and form. The objections
which have been raised against this view arise generally
from a mere misunderstanding. If we speak of
language as the outward realization of thought, we do
not mean language as deposited in a dictionary, or
sketched in a grammar; we mean language as an act,
language as being spoken, language as living and dying
with every word that is uttered. We might perhaps
call this speech, as distinguished from language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, though if we speak of language, we
mean chiefly phonetic articulate language, we do not
exclude the less perfect symbols of thought, such as
gestures, signs, or pictures. They, too, are language
in a certain sense, and they must be included in language
before we are justified in saying that discursive
thought can be realized in language only. One
instance will make this clear. We hold that we cannot
think without language. But can we not count
without language? We certainly can. We can form
the conception of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></span> without any spoken word, by
simply holding up three fingers. In the same manner,
the hand might stand for five, both hands for
ten, hands and feet for twenty.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> This is how people
who possessed no organs of speech would speak; this
is how the deaf and dumb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em> speak. Three fingers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are as good as three strokes, three strokes are as good
as three clicks of the tongue, three clicks of the
tongue are as good as the sound <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></span>,
or <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">trois</span></span>, or
<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">drei</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">shalosh</span></span> in Hebrew,
or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">san</span></span> in Chinese. All
these are signs, more or less perfect, but being signs,
they fall under the category of language; and all we
maintain is, that without some kind of sign, discursive
thought is impossible, and that in that sense,
language, or λόγος, is the only possible realization of
human thought.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another very common misunderstanding is this:
people imagine that, if it be impossible to think, except
in language, language and thought must be one
and the same thing. But a true philosophy of language
leads to the very opposite result. Every philosopher
would say that matter cannot exist without
form, nor form without matter, but no philosopher
would say that therefore it is impossible to distinguish
between form and matter. In the same way,
though we maintain that thought cannot exist without
language nor language without thought, we do
distinguish between thought and language, between
the inward and the outward λόγος, between the substance
and the form. Nay, we go a step beyond. We
admit that language necessarily reacts on thought,
and we see in this reaction, in this refraction of the
rays of language, the real solution of the old riddle
of mythology.

You will now see why these somewhat abstruse disquisitions
were necessary for our immediate purpose,
and I can promise those who have hitherto followed
me on this rather barren and rugged track, that they
will now be able to rest, and command, from the
point of view which we have reached, the whole panorama
of the mythology of the human mind.

We saw just now that the names of numbers may
most easily be replaced by signs. Numbers are simple
analytical conceptions, and for that very reason
they are not liable to mythology: name and conception
being here commensurate, no misunderstanding
is possible. But as soon as we leave this department
of thought, mythology begins. I shall try by at least
one example to show how mythology not only pervades
the sphere of religion or religious tradition, but
infects more or less the whole realm of thought.

When man wished for the first time to grasp and
express a distinction between the body and something
else within him distinct from the body, an easy
name that suggested itself was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">breath</span></span>. The breath
seemed something immaterial and almost invisible,
and it was connected with the life that pervaded the
body, for as soon as the breath ceased, the life of the
body became extinct. Hence the Greek name ψυχή,<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which originally meant breath, was chosen to express
at first the principle of life, as distinguished from the
decaying body, afterwards the incorporeal, the immaterial,
the undecaying, the immortal part of man—his
soul, his mind, his Self. All this was very natural.
When a person dies, we too say that he has
given up the ghost, and ghost, too, meant originally
spirit, and spirit meant breath.

A very instructive analogous case is quoted by Mr.
E. B. Tylor from a compendium of the theology of
the Indians of Nicaragua, the record of question and
answer in an inquest held by Father Francisco de
Bobadilla in the early days of the Spanish conquest.
Asked, among other things, concerning death, the Indians
said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Those who die in their houses go underground,
but those who are killed in war go to serve the gods
(<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">teotes</span></span>). When men die,
there comes forth from their mouth something which resembles a person,
and is called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">julio</span></span>
(Aztec <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">yuli</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">‘to live’</span>). This
being is like a person, but does not die, and the corpse
remains here.”</span> The Spanish ecclesiastics inquired
whether those who go on high keep the same body,
features, and limbs as here below; to which the Indians
answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“No, there is only the heart.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span> said the Spaniards, <span class="tei tei-q">“as the hearts are torn
out”</span> (they meant in the case of warriors who fell
into the hands of the enemy), <span class="tei tei-q">“what happens then?”</span>
Hereupon the Indians replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not precisely
the heart, but that which is in them, and makes them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
live, and which quits the body when they die;”</span> and
again they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not their heart which goes up
on high, but that which makes them live, that is, the
breath coming out from their mouth, which is called
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">julio</span></span>.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> asked the Spaniards, <span class="tei tei-q">“does this
heart, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">julio</span></span>, or soul, die with the body?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“When
the deceased has lived well,”</span> replied the Indians,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">julio</span></span> goes up on high with our gods; but when
he has lived ill, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">julio</span></span> perishes with the body, and
there is an end of it.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Greeks expressed the same idea by saying that
the ψυχή had left the body,<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> had fled through the

gone into Hades, which meant literally no more than
the place of the Invisible (Ἁίδης). That the breath
had become invisible was matter of fact; that it had
gone to the house of Hades, was mythology springing
spontaneously from the fertile soil of language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The primitive mythology was by no means necessarily
religious. In the very case which we have
chosen, philosophical mythology sprang up by the
side of religious mythology. The religious mythology
consisted in speaking of the spirits of the departed
as ghosts, as mere breath and air, as fluttering
about the gates of Hades, or ferried across the Styx
in the boat of Charon.<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The philosophical mythology, however, that sprang
from this name was much more important. We saw
that <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Psyche</span></span>, meaning originally the breathing
of the body, was gradually used in the sense of vital breath,
and as something independent of the body; and that
at last, when it had assumed the meaning of the immortal
part of man, it retained that character of
something independent of the body, thus giving rise
to the conception of a soul, not only as a being without
a body, but in its very nature opposed to body.
As soon as that opposition had been established in
language and thought, philosophy began its work in
order to explain how two such heterogeneous powers
could act on each other—how the soul could influence
the body, and how the body could determine
the soul. Spiritualistic and materialistic systems of
philosophy arose, and all this in order to remove a
self-created difficulty, in order to join together again
what language had severed, the living body and the
living soul. The question whether there is a soul or
spirit, whether there is in man something different
from the mere body, is not at all affected by this
mythological phraseology. We certainly can distinguish
between body and soul, but as long as we keep
within the limits of human knowledge, we have no
right to speak of the living soul as a breath, or of
spirits and ghosts as fluttering about like birds or
fairies. The poet of the nineteenth century says:—

And the same thought was expressed by Cicero two
thousand years ago: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whether the soul is air or fire,

spirits, however ethereal their bodies may be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though breath, or spirit, or ghost are the most
common names that were assigned through the metaphorical
nature of language to the vital, and afterwards
to the intellectual, principle in man, they were
by no means the only possible names. We speak,
for instance, of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shades</span></em> of the departed, which
meant originally their shadows. Those who first introduced
this expression—and we find it in the
most distant parts of the world<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a>—evidently took the
shadow as the nearest approach to what they wished
to express; something that should be incorporeal,
yet closely connected with the body. The Greek
εἰδῶλον, too, is not much more than the shadow,
while the Latin <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">manes</span></span>
meant probably in the beginning no more than the Little Ones,
the Small Folk.<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>
But the curious part, as showing again the influence
of language on thought, an influence more powerful
even than the evidence of the senses, is this, that
people who speak of the life or soul as the shadow of
the body, have brought themselves to believe that a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now return to mythology in the narrower
sense of the word. One of the earliest objects that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would strike and stir the mind of man, and for which
a sign or a name would soon be wanted, is surely the
Sun. It is very hard for us to realize the feelings
with which the first dwellers on the earth looked
upon the sun, or to understand fully what they
meant by a morning prayer, or a morning sacrifice.
Perhaps there are few people here present who have
watched a sunrise more than once or twice in their
lives; few people who have ever known the true
meaning of a morning prayer, or a morning sacrifice.
But think of man at the very dawn of time: forget
for a moment, if you can, after having read the fascinating
pages of Mr. Darwin, forget what man is supposed
to have been before he was man; forget it, because
it does not concern us here whether his bodily
form and frame were developed once for all in the
mind of a Creator, or gradually in the creation itself,
which from the first monad or protoplasm to the last
of the primates, or man, is not, I suppose, to be
looked on as altogether causeless, meaningless, purposeless;
think of him only as man (and man means
the thinker), with his mind yet lying fallow, though
full of germs—germs of which I hold as strongly as
ever no trace has ever, no trace will ever, be discovered
anywhere but in man; think of the Sun
awakening the eyes of man from sleep, and his mind
from slumber! Was not the Sunrise to him the
first wonder, the first beginning of all reflection, all
thought, all philosophy? was it not to him the first
revelation, the first beginning of all trust, of all religion?
To us that wonder of wonders has ceased to
exist, and few men now would even venture to speak
of the sun as Sir John Herschel has spoken, calling
him <span class="tei tei-q">“the Almoner of the Almighty, the delegated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dispenser to us of light and warmth, as well as the
centre of attraction, and as such, the immediate
source of all our comforts, and, indeed, of the very
possibility of our existence on earth.”</span><a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Man is a creature of habit, and wherever we can
watch him, we find that before a few generations
have passed he has lost the power of admiring what
is regular, and that he can see signs and wonders
only in what is irregular. Few nations only have
preserved in their ancient poetry some remnants of
the natural awe with which the earliest dwellers on
the earth saw that brilliant being slowly rising from
out the darkness of the night, raising itself by its
own might higher and higher, till it stood triumphant
on the arch of heaven, and then descended and
sank down in its fiery glory into the dark abyss of
the heaving and hissing sea. In the hymns of the
Veda the poet still wonders whether the sun will rise
again; he asks how he can climb the vault of heaven?
why he does not fall back? why there is no dust on
his path? And when the rays of the morning rouse
him from sleep and call him back to new life; when
he sees the sun, as he says, stretching out his golden
arms to bless the world and rescue it from the terrors
of darkness, he exclaims, <span class="tei tei-q">“Arise, our life, our spirit
has come back! the darkness is gone, the light approaches!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For so prominent an object in the primeval picture-gallery
of the human mind, a sign or a name
must have been wanted at a very early period. But
how was this to be achieved? As a mere sign, a
circle would have been sufficient, such as we find in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the hieroglyphics of Egypt, in the graphic system of
China, or even in our own astronomical tables. If
such a sign was fixed upon, we have a beginning of
language in the widest sense of the word, for we have
brought the Sun under the general concept of roundness,
and we have found a sign for this concept which
is made up of a large number of single sensuous impressions.
With such definite signs mythology has
little chance; yet the mere fact that the sun was
represented as a circle would favor the idea that the
sun was round; or, as ancient people, who had no adjective as yet
for round or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rotundus</span></span>,<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> would say,
that the sun was a wheel, a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rota</span></span>. If, on the contrary,
the round sign reminded the people of an eye,
then the sign of the sun would soon become the eye
of heaven, and germs of mythology would spring up
even from the barren soil of such hieroglyphic language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But now, suppose that a real name was wanted
for the sun, how could that be achieved?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We know that all words are derived from roots,
that these roots express general concepts, and that,
with few exceptions, every name is founded on a
general concept under which the object that has to
be named can be ranged. How these roots came to
be, is a question into which we need not enter at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
present. Their origin and growth form a problem of
psychology rather than of philology, and each science
must keep within its proper bounds. If a name was
wanted for snow, the early framers of language singled
out one of the general predicates of snow, its
whiteness, its coldness, or its liquidity, and called the
snow the white, the cold, or the liquid, by means of
roots conveying the general idea of whiteness, coldness,
or liquidity. Not only Nix, nivis, but Niobe<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a>
too, was a name of the snow, and meant the melting;
the death of her beautiful children by the arrows of
Apollon and Artemis represents the destruction of
winter by the rays of the sun. If the sun itself was
to be named, it might be called the brilliant, the
awakener, the runner, the ruler, the father, the giver
of warmth, of fertility, of life, the scorcher, the destroyer,
the messenger of death, and many other
names; but there was no possibility of naming it,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
except by laying hold of one of its characteristic
features, and expressing that feature by means of
one of the conceptual or predicative roots.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us trace the history of at least one of these
names. Before the Aryan nations separated, before
there was a Latin, a Greek, or a Sanskrit language,
there existed a root <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">svar</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sval</span></span>,
which meant to beam, to glitter, to warm. It exists in Greek, σέλας,
splendor; σελήνη, moon; in Anglo-Saxon, as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">swélan</span></span>,
to burn, to sweal; in modern German, <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">schwül</span></span>,
oppressively hot. From it we have in Sanskrit the
noun <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">svar</span></span>, meaning sometimes the sky, sometimes
the sun; and exactly the same word has been preserved
in Latin, as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sol</span></span>; in Gothic as
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sauil</span></span>; in Anglo-Saxon,
as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sol</span></span>. A secondary form of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">svar</span></span>
is the Sanskrit <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sûrya</span></span> for
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">svârya</span></span>, the sun, which is the same
word as the Greek ἥλιος.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All these names were originally mere predicates;
they meant bright, brilliant, warm. But as soon as
the name <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">svar</span></span> or
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">sûrya</span></span> was formed,
it became, through the irresistible influence of language, the name, not
only of a living, but of a male being. Every noun in
Sanskrit must be either a masculine or a feminine
(for the neuter gender was originally confined to the
nominative case), and as <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">sûrya</span></span> had been formed
as a masculine, language stamped it once for all as the
sign of a male being, as much as if it had been the
name of a warrior or a king. In other languages
where the name for sun is a feminine, and the sun is
accordingly conceived as a woman, as a queen, as the
bride of the moon, the whole mythology of the love-making
of the heavenly bodies is changed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You may say that all this shows, not so much the
influence of language on thought, as of thought on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
language; and that the sexual character of all words
reflects only the peculiarities of a child's mind, which
can conceive of nothing except as living, as male or
female. If a child hurts itself against a chair, it
beats and scolds the chair. The chair is looked upon
not as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it</span></em>, but as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></em>; it is the naughty chair, quite
as much as a boy is a naughty boy. There is some
truth in this, but it only serves to confirm the right
view of the influence of language on thought; for
this tendency, though in its origin intentional, and
therefore the result of thought, became soon a mere
rule of tradition in language, and it then reacted on
the mind with irresistible power. As soon, in fact,
as <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">sûryas</span></span> or ἥλιος appears as a masculine, we
are in the very thick of mythology. We have not yet arrived
at Helios as a god—that is a much later stage
of thought, which we might describe almost in the
words of Plato at the beginning of the seventh book
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Republic,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And after this, he will reason
that the sun is he who gives the seasons and the years,
and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world,
and in a certain way the cause of all things which
he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold.”</span>
We have not yet advanced so far, but we have
reached at least the first germs of a myth. In the
Homeric hymn to Helios, Helios is not yet called an
immortal, but only ἐπιείκελος ἀθανάτοισι, like unto immortals,
yet he is called the child of Euryphaessa, the
son of Hyperion, the grandson of Uranos and Gæa.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this is mythology; it is ancient language going
beyond its first intention.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor is there much difficulty in interpreting this
myth. Helios, the sun, is called the son of Hyperīon,
sometimes Hyperīon himself. This name Hyperīon
is derived from the preposition ὑπέρ, the Latin
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">super</span></span>,
which means above. It is derived by means of the
suffix -ιων, which originally was not a patronymic, but
simply expressed belonging to. So if Helios was
called Hyperion, this simply meant he who dwells
on high, and corresponds to Latin <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Summanus</span></span> or
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Superior</span></span>, or
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Excelsior</span></span>. If, on the contrary, Helios
is called Hyperionides, this, too, which meant originally
no more than he who comes from, or belongs
to those who dwell on high,<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> led to the myth that he
was the descendant of Hyperion; so that in this case,
as in the case of Zeus Kronīon, the son really led to
the conception of his father. Zeus Kronīon meant
originally no more than Zeus the eternal, the god of
ages, the ancient of days; but -ιων becoming usual as
a patronymic suffix, Kronion was supposed to mean
the son of Kronos. Kronos, the father, was created
in order to account for the existence of the name
Kronion. If Hyperīon is called the son of Euryphaessa,
the wide-shining, this requires no commentary;
for even at present a poet might say that the
sun is born of the wide-shining dawn. You see the
spontaneous generation of mythology with every new
name that is formed. As not only the sun, but also
the moon and the dawn could be called dwellers on
high, they, too, took the name of Hyperionis or
Hyperionides; and hence Homer called Selene, the
Moon, and Eos, the Dawn, sisters of Helios, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
daughters of Hyperion and Euryphaessa, the Dawn
doing service twice, both as mother, Euryphaessa,
and as daughter, Eos. Nay, according to Homer,
Euryphaessa, the Dawn, is not only the wife, but
also the sister of Helios. All this is perfectly intelligible,
if we watch the growth of language and mythology;
but it leads, of course, to the most tragic
catastrophes as soon as it is all taken in a literal
sense.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Helios is called ἀκάμας, the never-tiring; πανδερκής,
the all-seeing; φαέθων, the shining; and also φοῖβος,
the brilliant. This last epithet φοῖβος has grown into
an independent deity Phœbus, and it is particularly
known as a name of Apollon, Phoibos Apollon; thus
showing what is also known from other sources, that
in Apollo, too, we have one of the many mythic disguises
of the sun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So far all is clear, because all the names which we
have to deal with are intelligible, or, at all events,
yield to the softest etymological pressure. But now if
we hear the story of Phoibos Apollon falling in love
with Daphne, and Daphne praying to her mother, the
Earth, to save her from Phoibos; and if we read how
either the earth received her in her lap, and then a
laurel tree sprang up where she had disappeared, or
how she herself was changed into a laurel tree, what
shall we think of this? It is a mere story, it might
be said, and why should there be any meaning in it?
My answer is, because people do not tell such stories
of their gods and heroes, unless there is some sense in
them. Besides, if Phoibos means the sun, why
should not Daphne have a meaning too? Before,
therefore, we can decide whether the story of Phoibos
and Daphne is a mere invention, we must try to find
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
out what can have been the meaning of the word
Daphne.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Greek it means a laurel,<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> and this would explain
the purely Greek legend that Daphne was changed
into a laurel tree. But who was Daphne? In order
to answer this question, we must have recourse to
etymology, or, in other words, we must examine the
history of the word. Etymology, as you know, is no
longer what it used to be; and though there may still
be a classical scholar here and there who crosses himself
at the idea of a Greek word being explained by a
reference to Sanskrit, we naturally look to Sanskrit
as the master-key to many a lock which no Greek key
will open. Now Daphne, as I have shown, can be
traced back to Sanskrit Ahanâ, and Ahanâ in Sanskrit
means the dawn. As soon as we know this,
everything becomes clear. The story of Phoibos and
Daphne is no more than a description of what every
one may see every day; first, the appearance of the
Dawn in the eastern sky, then the rising of the Sun
as if hurrying after his bride, then the gradual fading
away of the bright Dawn at the touch of the fiery
rays of the sun, and at last her death or disappearance
in the lap of her mother, the Earth. All this seems
to me as clear as daylight, and the only objection
that could be raised against this reading of the ancient
myth would be, if it could be proved, that
Ahanâ does not mean Dawn, and that Daphne cannot
be traced back to Ahanâ, or that <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Helios</span></span> does
not mean the Sun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know there is another objection, but it seems to
me so groundless as hardly to deserve an answer.
Why, it is asked, should the ancient nations have told
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these endless stories about the Sun and the Dawn,
and why should they have preserved them in their
mythology? We might as well ask why the ancient
nations should have invented so many irregular verbs,
and why they should have preserved them in their
grammar. A fact does not cease to be a fact, because
we cannot at once explain it. As far as our knowledge
goes at present, we are justified in stating that
the Aryan nations preserved not only their grammatical
structure, and a large portion of their dictionary,
from the time which preceded their separation, but
that they likewise retained the names of some of their
deities, some legends about their gods, some popular
sayings and proverbs, and in these, it may be, the
seeds of parables, as part of their common Aryan
heirloom. Their mythological lore fills, in fact, a
period in the history of Aryan thought, half-way
between the period of language and the period of
literature, and it is this discovery which gives to mythology
its importance in the eyes of the student of
the most ancient history and psychology of mankind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And do not suppose that the Greeks, or the Hindus,
or the Aryan nations in general, were the only
people who possessed such tales. Wherever we look,
in every part of the world, among uncivilized as well
as a civilized people, we find the same kind of stories,
the same traditions, the same myths.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the Esquimaux of Repulse Bay, on the
west side of Hudson's Bay, on the Arctic Circle,
Mr. John Rae picked up the following story:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Many years ago, a great Esquimaux Conqueror
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gained so much power that he was able to rise unto
the heavens, taking with him on one occasion a sister,
a very beautiful girl, and some fire. He added much
fuel to the fire, and thus formed the Sun. For some
time he and his sister lived in great harmony, but
after a time he became very cruel, and ill-treated his
sister in many ways. She bore it at first with great
patience, until at last he threw fire at her, and
scorched one side of her face. This spoiling of her
beauty was beyond endurance; she therefore ran
away from him, and formed the Moon. Her brother
then began, and still continues to chase her; but although
he sometimes got near, he has not yet overtaken
her, nor ever will.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

There are dialectic varieties in the Mythology of
the Esquimaux as of the Greeks and Hindus, and,
with a change of gender between Sun and Moon, the
same story occurs among other tribes in the following
form:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There was a girl at a party, and some one told
his love for her by shaking her shoulders, after the

was in the dark hut, so she smeared her hands with
soot, and when he came back she blackened his
cheek with her hand. When a light was brought
she saw that it was her brother and fled. He ran
after her, followed her, and as she came to the end
of the earth, he sprang out into the sky. Then she
became the sun, and he the moon, and this is why
the moon is always chasing the sun through the
heavens, and why the moon is sometimes dark as he
turns his blackened cheek towards the earth.”</span><a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a>

We now turn to the South, and here, among the
lowest of the low, among the Hottentots, who are
despised even by their black neighbors, the Zulus,
we find the following gem of a fable, beaming with
mingled rays of religion and philosophy:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Moon, it is said, sent once an insect to men,
saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Go thou to men, and tell them, As I die,
and dying live, so ye shall also die, and dying live.’</span>
The insect started with the message, but whilst on
his way was overtaken by the hare, who asked:
<span class="tei tei-q">‘On what errand art thou bound?’</span> The insect
answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I am sent by the Moon to men, to tell
them that as she dies and dying lives, they also shall
die and dying live.’</span> The hare said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘As thou art
an awkward runner, let me go’</span> (to take the message).
With these words he ran off, and when he
reached men, he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I am sent by the Moon to
tell you, As I die, and dying perish, in the same
manner ye also shall die and come wholly to an end.’</span>
Then the hare returned to the Moon, and told her
what he had said to men. The Moon reproached
him angrily, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Darest thou tell the people a
thing which I have not said?’</span> With these words
she took up a piece of wood, and struck him on the
nose. Since that day the hare's nose is slit.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of this story, too, there are various versions and
in one of them the end is as follows:—

<span class="tei tei-q">“The hare, having returned to the Moon, was
questioned as to the message delivered, and the
Moon, having heard the true state of the case, became
so enraged with him that she took up a hatchet
to split his head; falling short, however, of that, the
hatchet fell upon the upper lip of the hare, and cut
it severely. Hence it is that we see the <span class="tei tei-q">‘hare-lip.’</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

received on that occasion.”</span><a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a>

The Finns, Lapps, and Esthonians do not seem a
very poetical race, yet there is poetry even in their
smoky huts, poetry surrounded with all the splendor

Wanna Issi assented, and henceforth Koit handed
the torch every evening to Ämmarik, and Ämmarik
took it and extinguished it. Only during four
weeks in summer they remain together at midnight;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Koit hands the dying torch to Ämmarik, but Ämmarik
does not let it die, but lights it again with her
breath. Then their hands are stretched out, and
their lips meet, and the blush of the face of Ämmarik
colors the midnight sky.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This myth requires hardly any commentary; yet
as long as it is impossible to explain the names,
Wanna Issi, Koit, and Ämmarik, it might be said
that the story was but a love story, invented by an
idle Lapp, or Finn, or Esthonian. But what if Wanna
Issi in Esthonian means the Old Father, and if Koit
means the Dawn? Can we then doubt any longer
that Ämmarik<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>
must be the Gloaming and that
their meeting in the summer reflects those summer
evenings when, particularly in the North, the torch
of the sun seems never to die, and when the Gloaming
is seen kissing the Dawn?

I wish I could tell you some more of these stories
which have been gathered from all parts of the world,
and which, though they may be pronounced childish
and tedious by some critics, seem to me to glitter
with the brightest dew of nature's own poetry, and
to contain those very touches that make us feel akin,
not only with Homer or Shakespeare, but even with
Lapps, and Finns, and Kaffirs.

If people cannot bring themselves to believe in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
solar and celestial myths among the Hindus and
Greeks, let them study the folk-lore of the Semitic
and Turanian races. I know there is, on the part of
some of our most distinguished scholars, the same
objection against comparing Aryan to non-Aryan
myths, as there is against any attempt to explain
the features of Sanskrit or Greek by a reference to
Finnish or Bask. In one sense that objection is well
founded, for nothing would create greater confusion
than to ignore the genealogical principle as the only
safe one in a scientific classification of languages, of
myths, and even of customs. We must first classify
our myths and legends, as we classify our languages
and dialects. We must first of all endeavor to explain
what wants explanation in one member of a
family by a reference to other members of the same
family, before we allow ourselves to glance beyond.
But there is in a comparative study of languages and
myths not only a philological, but also a philosophical,
and, more particularly, a psychological interest, and
though even in this more general study of mankind
the frontiers of language and race ought never to disappear,
yet they can no longer be allowed to narrow
or intercept our view. How much the student of
Aryan mythology and ethnology may gain for his
own progress by allowing himself a wider survey over
the traditions and customs of the whole human race,
is best known to those who have studied the works of
Klemm, Waitz, Bastian, Sir John Lubbock, Mr. Tylor,
and Dr. Callaway. What is prehistoric in language
among the Aryan nations, is frequently found
as still historic among Turanian races. The same
applies with regard to religions, myths, legends, and
customs. Among Finns and Lapps, among Zulus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Maoris, among Khonds and Karens, we sometimes
find the most startling analogies to Aryan traditions,
and we certainly learn, again and again, this
one important lesson, that as in language, so in
mythology, there is nothing which had not originally
a meaning, that every name of the gods and heroes
had a beginning, a purpose, and a history.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jupiter was no more called Jupiter by accident,
than the Polynesian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Maui</span></span>, the Samoyede
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Num</span></span>, or the
Chinese <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Tien</span></span>.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a>
If we can discover the original meaning
of these names, we have reached the first ground
of their later growth. I do not say that, if we can
explain the first purpose of the mythological names,
we have solved the whole riddle of mythology, but I
maintain that we have gained firm ground. I maintain
that every true etymology gives us an historical
fact, because the first giving of a name was an historical
fact, and an historical fact of the greatest importance
for the later development of ancient ideas.
Think only of this one fact, which no one would now
venture to doubt, that the supreme deity of the
Greeks, the Romans, the Germans, is called by the
same name as the supreme deity of the earliest Aryan
settlers in India. Does not this one fact draw away
the curtain from the dark ages of antiquity, and open
before our eyes an horizon which we can hardly measure
by years? The Greek <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Zeus</span></span> is the same word as
the Latin <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ju</span></span> in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jupiter</span></span>, as the German
<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Tiu</span></span>; and all
these were merely dialectic varieties of the Vedic
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Dyaus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> Now <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">dyaus</span></span> in Sanskrit is the name
of the sky, if used as a feminine; if used as a masculine,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as it is still in the Veda, it is the sky as a man or as
a god—it is Zeus, the father of gods and men. You
know, of course, that the whole language of ancient
India is but a sister dialect of Greek, Latin, of German,
Keltic, and Slavonic, and that if the Greek says
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">es-ti</span></span>, he is, if the Roman says
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">est</span></span>, the German
<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">ist</span></span>, the
Slave <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">yesté</span></span>, the Hindu, three thousand years ago,
said <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">as-ti</span></span>, he is. This
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">as-ti</span></span> is a compound of a root
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></span>, to be, and the pronoun
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ti</span></span>. The root meant originally
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to breathe</span></span>, and dwindled down after a time to
the meaning of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to be</span></span>. All this must have happened
before a single Greek or German reached the shores
of Europe, and before a single Brahman descended
into the plains of India. At that distant time we
must place the gradual growth of language and ideas,
of a language which we are still speaking, of ideas
which we are still thinking; and at the same time
only can we explain the framing of those names
which were the first attempts at grasping supernatural
powers, which became in time the names of the
deities of the ancient world, the heroes of mythology,
the chief actors in many a legend, nay, some of
which have survived in the nursery tales of our own
time.<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My time, I see, is nearly over, but before I finish,
I feel that I have a duty to perform from which I
ought not to shrink. Some of those who have honored
me with their presence to-night may recollect
that about a year ago a lecture was delivered in this
very room by Professor Blackie, in which he tried to
throw discredit on the scientific method of the interpretation
of popular myths, or on what I call Comparative
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mythology. Had he confined his remarks
to the subject itself, I should have felt most grateful
for his criticisms, little minding the manner in which
they were conveyed—for a student of language
knows what words are made of. Nor, had his personal
reflections concerned myself alone, should I have
felt called upon to reply to them thus publicly, for it
has always seemed to me that unless we protest
against unmerited praise, we have no right to protest
against unmerited abuse. I believe I can appeal to
all here present, that during the many years I have
had the honor to lecture in this Institution, I have
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not once</span></em> allowed myself to indulge in any personal
remarks, or attacked those who, being absent, cannot
defend themselves. Even when I had to answer objections,
or to refute false theories, I have always
most carefully avoided mentioning the names of living
writers. But as Professor Blackie has directed
his random blows, not against myself, but against a
friend of mine, Mr. Cox, the author of a work on
Aryan Mythology, I feel that I must for once try
to get angry, and return blow for blow. Professor
Blackie speaks of Mr. Cox as if he had done nothing
beyond repeating what I had said before. Nothing
can be more unfair. My own work in Comparative
Mythology has consisted chiefly in laying down some
of the general principles of that science, and in the
etymological interpretation of some of the ancient
names of gods, goddesses, and heroes. In fact, I have
made it a rule never to interpret or to compare the
legends of India, Greece, Italy, or Germany, except
in cases where it was possible, first of all, to show an
identity or similarity in the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin,
or German names of the principal actors. Mr. Cox
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
having convinced himself that the method which I
have followed in mythology rests on sound and truly
scientific principles, has adopted most, though by no
means all, of my etymological interpretations. Professor
Blackie, on the contrary, without attempting
any explanation of the identity of mythological names
in Greek and Sanskrit which must be either disproved
or explained, thunders forth the following sentence
of condemnation: <span class="tei tei-q">“Even under the scientific guidance
of a Bopp, a Bott, a Grimm, and a Müller, a
sober man may sometimes, even in the full blaze of
the new sun of comparative philology, allow himself
to drink deep draughts, if not of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">maundering madness</span></em>,
at least of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manifest hallucination</span></em>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If such words are thrown at my head, I pick them
up chiefly as etymological curiosities, and as striking
illustrations of what Mr. Tylor calls <span class="tei tei-q">“survivals in
culture,”</span> showing how the most primitive implements
of warfare, rude stones and unpolished flints, which
an ethnologist would suppose to be confined to prehistoric
races, to the red Indians of America or the
wild Picts of Caledonia, turn up again most unexpectedly
at the present day in the very centre of civilized
life. All I can say is, that if, as a student of
Comparative Mythology, I have been drinking deep
draughts of maundering madness, I have been drinking
in good company. In this respect Mr. Cox has
certainly given me far more credit than I deserve. I
am but one out of many laborers in this rich field of
scientific research, and he ought to have given far
greater prominence to the labors of Grimm, Burnouf,
Bopp, and, before all, of my learned friend, Professor
Kuhn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But while, with regard to etymology, Mr. Cox contents
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
himself with reporting the results of other scholars,
he stands quite independent in his own treatment
of Comparative Mythology. Of this Professor Blackie
seems to have no suspicion whatever. The plan which
Mr. Cox follows is to collect the coincidences in the
legends themselves, and to show how in different
myths the same story with slight variations is told
again and again of different gods and heroes. In this
respect his work is entirely original and very useful;
for although these coincidences may be explained in
different ways, and do not afford a proof of a common
historical origin of the mythologies of India, Greece,
Italy, and Germany, they are all the more interesting
from a purely psychological point of view, and supply
important material for further researches. Mr. Tylor
has lately worked with great success in the same rich
mine; extending the limits of mythological research
far beyond the precincts of the Aryan world, and
showing that there are solar myths wherever the sun
shines. I differ from Mr. Cox on many points, as he
differs from me. I shall certainly keep to my own
method of never attempting an interpretation or a
comparison, except where the ground has first been
cleared of all uncertainty by etymological research,
and where the names of different gods and heroes
have been traced back to a common source. I call this
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nominalistic</span></span> as opposed to the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">realistic</span></span> method of
Comparative Mythology, and it is the former only
that concerns the student of the Science of Language.
I gratefully acknowledge, however, the help which I
have received from Mr. Cox's work, particularly as
suggesting new clusters of myths that might be disentangled
by etymological analysis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But not only has Professor Blackie failed to perceive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the real character of Mr. Cox's researches, but
he has actually charged him with holding opinions
which both Mr. Cox and myself have repeatedly disavowed,
and most strenuously opposed. Again and
again have we warned the students of Comparative
Mythology that they must not expect to be able to
explain everything. Again and again have we pointed
out that there are irrational elements in mythology,
and that we must be prepared to find grains of local
history on which, as I said,<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a>
the sharpest tools of
Comparative Mythology must bend or break. Again and again have we shown that
historical persons<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a>—not
only Cyrus and Charlemagne, but Frederick Barbarossa
and even Frederick the Great—have been
drawn into the vortex of popular mythology. Yet
these are the words of Professor Blackie: <span class="tei tei-q">“The cool
way in which Max Müller and his English disciple,
Mr. Cox, assume that there are no human figures and
historical characters in the whole gallery of heroes
and demi-gods in the Greek Mythology, is something
very remarkable.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I readily admit that some of the etymologies which
I have proposed of mythological names are open to
criticism; and if, like other scholars, Professor Blackie
had pointed out to me any cases where I might seem
to him to have offended against Grimm's law or other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
phonetic rules, I should have felt most grateful; but
if he tells me that the Greek Erinys should not be
derived from the Sanskrit Sara<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>yû, but from the
Greek verb ἐρινύειν, to be angry, he might as well derive
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">critic</span></span> from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to
criticise</span></span>;<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>
and if he maintains
that a name may have two or three legitimate etymologies,
I can only answer that we might as well
say that a child could have two or three legitimate
mothers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have most reluctantly entered upon these somewhat
personal explanations, and I should not have
done so if I alone had been concerned in Professor
Blackie's onslaught. I hope, however, that I have
avoided anything that could give just offence to Professor
Blackie, even if he should be present here tonight.
Though he abuses me as a German, and
laughs at the instinctive aversion to external facts
and the extravagant passion for self-evolved ideas as
national failings of all Germans (I only wonder that
the story of the camel and the inner consciousness
did not come in), yet I know that for many years
German poetry and German scholarship have had few
more ardent admirers, and German scholars few more
trusty friends, than Professor Blackie. Nationality,
it seems to me, has as little to do with scholarship as
with logic. On the contrary, in every nation he that
will work hard and reason honestly may be sure to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
discover some grains of truth. National jealousies
and animosities have no place in the republic of letters,
which is, and I trust always will be, the true international
republic of all friends of work, of order,
and of truth.

Very different from the real similarities that can
be discovered in nearly all the religions of the world,
and which, owing to their deeply human character,
in no way necessitate the admission that one religion
borrowed from the other, are those minute coincidences
between the Jewish and the Pagan religions
which have so often been discussed by learned theologians,
and which were intended by them as proof
positive, either that the Pagans borrowed their religious
ideas direct from the Old Testament, or that
some fragments of a primeval revelation, granted to
the ancestors of the whole race of mankind, had been
preserved in the temples of Greece and Italy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bochart, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Geographia Sacra,”</span> considered
the identity of Noah and Saturn so firmly established
as hardly to admit of the possibility of a doubt. The
three sons of Saturn—Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto—he
represented as having been originally the three
sons of Noah: Jupiter being Ham; Neptune, Japhet;
and Shem, Pluto. Even in the third generation the two
families were proved to have been one, for Phut,
the son of Ham, or of Jupiter Hammon, could be no
other than Apollo Pythius; Canaan no other than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mercury; and Nimrod no other than Bacchus, whose
original name was supposed to have been Bar-chus,
the son of Cush. G. J. Vossius, in his learned work,
<span class="tei tei-q">“De Origine et Progressu Idolatriæ”</span> (1688), identified
Saturn with Adam, Janus with Noah, Pluto with
Ham, Neptune with Japhet, Minerva with Naamah,
Vulcan with Tubal Cain, Typhon with Og. Huet,
the friend of Bochart, and the colleague of Bossuet,
went still farther; and in his classical work, the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Demonstratio Evangelica,”</span> he attempted to prove
that the whole theology of the heathen nations was
borrowed from Moses, whom he identified not only
with ancient law-givers, like Zoroaster and Orpheus,
but with gods and demi-gods, such as Apollo, Vulcan,
Faunus, and Priapus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this happened not more than two hundred
years ago; and even a hundred years ago, nay, even
after the discovery of Sanskrit and the rise of Comparative
Philology, the troublesome ghost of Huet was
by no means laid at once. On the contrary, as soon
as the ancient language and religion of India became
known in Europe, they were received by many people
in the same spirit. Sanskrit, like all other languages,
was to be derived from Hebrew, the ancient religion
of the Brahmans from the Old Testament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was at that time an enthusiasm among Oriental
scholars, particularly at Calcutta, and an interest
for Oriental antiquities in the public at large, of
which we in these days of apathy for Eastern literature
can hardly form an adequate idea. Everybody
wished to be first in the field, and to bring to light
some of the treasures which were supposed to be hidden
in the sacred literature of the Brahmans. Sir
William Jones, the founder of the Asiatic Society
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at Calcutta, published in the first volume of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Asiatic Researches”</span> his famous essay, <span class="tei tei-q">“On the
Gods of Greece, Italy, and India;”</span> and he took particular
care to state that his essay, though published
only in 1788, had been written in 1784. In that essay
he endeavored to show that there existed an intimate
connection, not only between the mythology of
India and that of Greece and Italy, but likewise between
the legendary stories of the Brahmans and the
accounts of certain historical events as recorded in
the Old Testament. No doubt, the temptation was
great. No one could look down for a moment into
the rich mine of religious and mythological lore that
was suddenly opened before the eyes of scholars and
theologians, without being struck by a host of similarities,
not only in the languages, but also in the ancient
traditions of the Hindus, the Greeks, and the
Romans; and if at that time the Greeks and Romans
were still supposed to have borrowed their language
and their religion from Jewish quarters, the same
conclusion could hardly be avoided with regard to
the language and the religion of the Brahmans of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first impulse to look in the ancient religion of
India for reminiscences of revealed truth seems to
have come from missionaries rather than from scholars.
It arose from a motive, in itself most excellent,
of finding some common ground for those who wished
to convert and those who were to be converted. Only,
instead of looking for that common ground where it
really was to be found—namely, in the broad foundations
on which all religions are built up: the belief
in a divine power, the acknowledgment of sin, the
habit of prayer, the desire to offer sacrifice, and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hope of a future life—the students of Pagan religion
as well as Christian missionaries were bent on
discovering more striking and more startling coincidences,
in order to use them in confirmation of their
favorite theory that some rays of a primeval revelation,
or some reflection of the Jewish religion, had
reached the uttermost ends of the world. This was
a dangerous proceeding—dangerous because superficial,
dangerous because undertaken with a foregone
conclusion; and very soon the same arguments that
had been used on one side in order to prove that all
religious truth had been derived from the Old Testament
were turned against Christian scholars and
Christian missionaries, in order to show that it was
not Brahmanism and Buddhism which had borrowed
from the Old and New Testament, but that the Old
and the New Testament had borrowed from the more
ancient religions of the Brahmans and Buddhists.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This argument was carried out, for instance, in
Holwell's <span class="tei tei-q">“Original Principles of the Ancient Brahmans,”</span>
published in London as early as 1779, in which
the author maintains that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Brahmanic religion is
the first and purest product of supernatural revelation,”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“that the Hindu scriptures contain to a
moral certainty the original doctrines and terms of
restoration delivered from God himself, by the mouth
of his first created Birmah, to mankind, at his first
creation in the form of man.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sir William Jones<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> tells us that one or two missionaries
in India had been absurd enough, in their
zeal for the conversion of the Gentiles, to urge <span class="tei tei-q">“that
the Hindus were even now almost Christians, because
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesa were no
other than the Christian Trinity;”</span> a sentence in
which, he adds, we can only doubt whether folly, ignorance,
or impiety predominates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sir William Jones himself was not likely to fall
into that error. He speaks against it most emphatically.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Either,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“the first eleven chapters
of Genesis—all due allowance being made for a figurative
Eastern style—are true, or the whole fabric
of our national religion is false; a conclusion which
none of us, I trust, would wish to be drawn. But it
is not the truth of our national religion as such that
I have at heart; it is truth itself; and if any cool,
unbiassed reasoner will clearly convince me that
Moses drew his narrative through Egyptian conduits
from the primeval fountains of Indian literature, I
shall esteem him as a friend for having weeded my
mind from a capital error, and promise to stand
amongst the foremost in assisting to circulate the
truth which he has ascertained.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But though he speaks so strongly against the uncritical
proceedings of those who would derive anything
that is found in the Old Testament from Indian
sources, Sir William Jones himself was really
guilty of the same want of critical caution in his own
attempts to identify the gods and heroes of Greece
and Rome with the gods and heroes of India. He
begins his essay,<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“On the Gods of Greece, Italy, and
India,”</span> with the following remarks:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We cannot justly conclude, by arguments preceding
the proof of facts, that one idolatrous people
must have borrowed their deities, rites, and tenets
from another, since gods of all shapes and dimensions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
may be framed by the boundless powers of imagination,
or by the frauds and follies of men, in countries
never connected; but when features of resemblance,
too strong to have been accidental, are observable in
different systems of polytheism, without fancy or
prejudice to color them and improve the likeness, we
can scarce help believing that some connection has
immemorially subsisted between the several nations
who have adopted them. It is my design in this essay
to point out such a resemblance between the popular
worship of the old Greeks and Italians and that
of the Hindus; nor can there be any room to doubt
of a great similarity between their strange religions
and that of Egypt, China, Persia, Phrygia, Phœnice,
and Syria; to which, perhaps, we may safely add
some of the southern kingdoms, and even islands of
America; while the Gothic system which prevailed
in the northern regions of Europe was not merely
similar to those of Greece and Italy, but almost the
same in another dress, with an embroidery of images
apparently Asiatic. From all this, if it be satisfactorily
proved, we may infer a general union or affinity
between the most distinguished inhabitants of the
primitive world at the time when they deviated, as
they did too early deviate, from the rational adoration
of the only true God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here, then, in an essay written nearly a hundred
years ago by Sir W. Jones, one of the most celebrated
Oriental scholars in England, it might seem as if we
should find the first outlines of that science which is
looked upon as but of to-day or yesterday—the outlines
of Comparative Mythology. But in such an
expectation we are disappointed. What we find is
merely a superficial comparison of the mythology of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
India and that of other nations, both Aryan and
Semitic, without any scientific value, because carried
out without any of those critical tests which alone
keep Comparative Mythology from running riot.
This is not intended as casting a slur on Sir W.
Jones. At his time the principles which have now
been established by the students of the science of
language were not yet known, and as with words, so
with the names of deities, similarity of sound, the
most treacherous of all sirens, was the only guide in
such researches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not pleasant to have to find fault with a man
possessed of such genius, taste, and learning as Sir
W. Jones, but no one who is acquainted with the history
of these researches will be surprised at my words.
It is the fate of all pioneers, not only to be left behind
in the assault which they had planned, but to
find that many of their approaches were made in a
false direction, and had to be abandoned. But as the
authority of their names continues to sway the public
at large, and is apt to mislead even painstaking students
and to entail upon them repeated disappointments,
it is necessary that those who know should
speak out, even at the risk of being considered harsh
or presumptuous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few instances will suffice to show how utterly
baseless the comparisons are which Sir W. Jones instituted
between the gods of India, Greece, and Italy.
He compares the Latin Janus with the Sanskrit deity
Ganesa. It is well known that Janus is connected
with the same root that has yielded the names of
Jupiter, Zeus, and Dyaus, while Ganesa is a compound,
meaning lord of hosts, lord of the companies
of gods.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Saturnus is supposed to have been the same as
Noah, and is then identified by Sir W. Jones with
the Indian Manu Satyavrata, who escaped from the
flood. Ceres is compared with the goddess Sri, Jupiter
or Diespiter with Indra or Divaspati; and though
etymology is called a weak basis for historical inquiries,
the three syllables Jov in Jovis, Zeu in Zeus,
and Siv in Siva are placed side by side, as possibly
containing the same root, only differently pronounced.
Now the s of Siva is a palatal s, and no scholar who
has once looked into a book on Comparative Philology
need be told that such an s could never correspond
to a Greek Zeta or a Latin J.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In K<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ri</span></span>sh<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>a, the lovely shepherd-god,
Sir W. Jones recognizes the features of Apollo Nomius, who fed
the herds of Admetus, and slew the dragon Python;
and he leaves it to etymologists to determine whether
Gopâla—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span></span>, the cow-herd—may not be the same
word as Apollo. We are also assured, on the authority
of Colonel Vallancey, that K<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ri</span></span>sh<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>a in
Irish means the sun, and that the goddess Kâlî, to whom human
sacrifices were offered, as enjoined in the Vedas (?)
was the same as Hekate. In conclusion, Sir W.
Jones remarks, <span class="tei tei-q">“I strongly incline to believe that
Egyptian priests have actually come from the Nile to
the Gangâ and Yamunâ, and that they visited the
Sarmans of India, as the sages of Greece visited them,
rather to acquire than to impart knowledge.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The interest that had been excited by Sir William
Jones's researches did not subside, though he himself
did not return to the subject, but devoted his great
powers to more useful labors. Scholars, both in India
and in Europe, wanted to know more of the ancient
religion of India. If Jupiter, Apollo, and Janus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had once been found in the ancient pantheon of the
Brahmans; if the account of Noah and the deluge
could be traced back to the story of Manu Satyavrata,
who escaped from the flood, more discoveries might
be expected in this newly-opened mine, and people
rushed to it with all the eagerness of gold-diggers.
The idea that everything in India was of extreme
antiquity had at that time taken a firm hold on the
minds of all students of Sanskrit; and, as there was
no one to check their enthusiasm, everything that
came to light in Sanskrit literature was readily accepted
as more ancient than Homer, or even than the
Old Testament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was under these influences that Lieutenant Wilford,
a contemporary of Sir William Jones at Calcutta,
took up the thread which Sir William Jones
had dropped, and determined at all hazards to solve
the question which at that time had excited a worldwide
interest. Convinced that the Brahmans possessed
in their ancient literature the originals, not
only of Greek and Roman mythology, but likewise
of the Old Testament history, he tried every possible
means to overcome their reserve and reticence. He
related to them, as well as he could, the principal
stories of classical mythology, and the leading events
in the history of the Old Testament; he assured
them that they would find the same things in their
ancient books, if they would but look for them; he
held out the hopes of ample rewards for any extracts
from their sacred literature containing the histories
of Adam and Eve, of Deukalion and Prometheus;
and at last he succeeded. The coyness of the Pandits
yielded; the incessant demand created a supply;
and for several years essay after essay appeared in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Asiatic Researches,”</span> with extracts from Sanskrit
MSS., containing not only the names of Deukalion,
Prometheus, and other heroes and deities of
Greece, but likewise the names of Adam and Eve, of
Abraham and Sarah, and all the rest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Great was the surprise, still greater the joy, not
only in Calcutta, but in London, at Paris, and all the
universities of Germany. The Sanskrit MSS. from
which Lieutenant Wilford quoted, and on which his
theories were based, had been submitted to Sir W.
Jones and other scholars; and though many persons
were surprised, and for a time even incredulous, yet
the fact could not be denied that all was found in
these Sanskrit MSS. as stated by Lieutenant Wilford.
Sir W. Jones, then President of the Asiatic
Society, printed the following declaration at the end
of the third volume of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Asiatic Researches”</span>:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Since I am persuaded that the learned essay on
Egypt and the Nile has afforded you equal delight
with that which I have myself received from it, I
cannot refrain from endeavoring to increase your satisfaction
by confessing openly that I have at length
abandoned the greatest part of the natural distrust,
and incredulity which had taken possession of my
mind before I had examined the sources from which
our excellent associate, Lieutenant Wilford, has drawn
so great a variety of new and interesting opinions.
Having lately read again and again, both alone and
with a Pandit, the numerous original passages in the
Purânas, and other Sanskrit books, which the writer
of the dissertation adduces in support of his assertions,
I am happy in bearing testimony to his perfect
good faith and general accuracy, both in his extracts
and in the translation of them.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sir W. Jones then proceeds himself to give a translation
of some of these passages. <span class="tei tei-q">“The following

After this testimony from Sir W. Jones—wrung
from him, as it would seem, against his own wish and
will—Lieutenant Wilford's essays became more numerous
and more startling every year.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At last, however, the coincidences became too
great. The MSS. were again carefully examined;
and then it was found that a clever forgery had been
committed, that leaves had been inserted in ancient
MSS., and that on these leaves the Pandits, urged by
Lieutenant Wilford to disclose their ancient mysteries
and traditions, had rendered in correct Sanskrit verse
all that they had heard about Adam and Abraham
from their inquisitive master. Lieutenant (then Colonel)
Wilford did not hesitate for one moment to
confess publicly that he had been imposed upon; but
in the meantime the mischief had been done, his
essays had been read all over Europe, they retained
their place in the volumes of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Asiatic Researches,”</span>
and to the present day some of his statements
and theories continue to be quoted authoritatively
by writers on ancient religion.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such accidents, and, one might almost say, such
misfortunes, will happen, and it would be extremely
unfair were we to use unnecessarily harsh language
with regard to those to whom they have happened.
It is perfectly true that at present, after the progress
that has been made in an accurate and critical study
of Sanskrit, it would be unpardonable if any Sanskrit
scholar accepted such passages as those translated by
Sir W. Jones as genuine. Yet it is by no means
certain that a further study of Sanskrit will not lead
to similar disenchantments, and deprive many a book
in Sanskrit literature which now is considered as very
ancient of its claims to any high antiquity. Certain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
portions of the Veda even, which, as far as our knowledge
goes at present, we are perfectly justified in referring
to the tenth or twelfth century before our era,
may some day or other dwindle down from their high
estate, and those who have believed in their extreme
antiquity will then be held up to blame or ridicule,
like Sir W. Jones or Colonel Wilford. This cannot
be avoided, for science is progressive, and does not
acknowledge, even in the most distinguished scholars,
any claims to infallibility. One lesson only may we
learn from the disappointment that befell Colonel
Wilford, and that is to be on our guard against anything
which in ordinary language would be called
<span class="tei tei-q">“too good to be true.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Comparative Philology has taught us again and
again that when we find a word exactly the same in
Greek and Sanskrit, we may be certain that it cannot
be the same word; and the same applies to Comparative
Mythology. The same god or the same
hero cannot have exactly the same name in Sanskrit
and Greek, for the simple reason that Sanskrit and
Greek have deviated from each other, have both followed
their own way, have both suffered their own
phonetic corruptions; and hence, if they do possess
the same word, they can only possess it either in its
Greek or its Sanskrit disguise. And if that caution
applies to Sanskrit and Greek, members of the same
family of language, how much more strongly must it
apply to Sanskrit and Hebrew! If the first man
were called in Sanskrit Âdima, and in Hebrew Adam,
and if the two were really the same word, then Hebrew
and Sanskrit could not be members of two different
families of speech, or we should be driven to
admit that Adam was borrowed by the Jews from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Hindus for it is in Sanskrit only that âdima
means the first, whereas in Hebrew it has no such
meaning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same remark applies to a curious coincidence
pointed out many years ago by Mr. Ellis in his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Polynesian Researches”</span> (London, 1829, vol. ii. p.
38). We there read:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A very generally received Tahitian tradition is
that the first human pair were made by Taaroa, the
principal deity formerly acknowledged by the nation.
On more than one occasion I have listened to the details
of the people respecting his work of creation.
They say that, after Taaroa had formed the world,
he created man out of araea, red earth, which was
also the food of man until bread first was made. In
connection with this some relate that Taaroa one day
called for the man by name. When he came, he
caused him to fall asleep, and, while he slept, he
took out one of his <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ivi</span></span>, or bones, and with it made
a woman, whom he gave to the man as his wife, and
they became the progenitors of mankind. This,”</span>
Mr. Ellis continues, <span class="tei tei-q">“always appeared to me a mere
recital of the Mosaic account of creation, which they
had heard from some European, and I never placed
any reliance on it, although they have repeatedly
told me it was a tradition among them before any
foreigners arrived. Some have also stated that the
woman's name was <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ivi</span></span>, which would be by them pronounced
as if written <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Eve</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ivi</span></span>
is an aboriginal word, and not only signifies a bone, but also a widow, and
a victim slain in war. Notwithstanding the assertion
of the natives, I am disposed to think that <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ivi</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Eve</span></span>, is the only aboriginal part of the story, as far as
it respects the mother of the human race. Should
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more careful and minute inquiry confirm the truth of
this declaration, and prove that their account was in
existence among them prior to their intercourse with
Europeans, it will be the most remarkable and valuable
oral tradition of the origin of the human race
yet known.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this case, I believe the probability is that the
story of the creation of the first woman from the
bone of a man<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> existed among the Tahitians before
their intercourse with Christians, but I need hardly
add that the similarity between the Polynesian name
for bone, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ivi</span></span>, even when it was used as the name of
the first woman, and the English corruption of the
Hebrew הוה, Chāvah, Eve, could be the result of accident
only. Whatever Chāvah meant in Hebrew,
whether life or living or anything else, it never meant
bone, while the Tahitian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ivi</span></span>, the Maori
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">wheva</span></span>,<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> meant
bone, and bone only.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These principles and these cautions were hardly
thought of in the days of Sir William Jones and
Colonel Wilford, but they ought to be thought of at
present. Thus, before Bopp had laid down his code
of phonetic laws, and before Burnouf had written his
works on Buddhism, one cannot be very much surprised
that Buddha should have been identified with
Minos and Lamech; nay, that even the Babylonian
deity Belus, and the Teutonic deity Wodan or Odin,
should have been supposed to be connected with the
founder of Buddhism in India. As Burnouf said in
his <span class="tei tei-q">“Introduction a l'Histoire du Buddhisme,”</span> p. 70:
<span class="tei tei-q">“On avait même fait du Buddha une planète; et je
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ne sais pas si quelques savants ne se plaisent pas encore
aujourd'hui à retrouver ce sage paisible sous les
traits du belliqueux Odin.”</span> But we did not expect
that we should have to read again, in a book published
in 1869, such statements as these:<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There is certainly a much greater similarity between
the Buddhism of the Topes and the Scandinavian
mythology than between it and the Buddhism
of the books; but still the gulf between the two is
immense; and if any traces of the doctrines of the
gentle ascetic (Buddha) ever existed in the bosom of
Odin or his followers, while dwelling near the roots
of the Caucasus, all that can be said is, that they
suffered fearful shipwreck among the rocks of the
savage superstitions of the North, and sank, never
again to appear on the surface of Scandinavian mythology.
If the two religions come anywhere in contact,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it is at their base, for underlying both there existed
a strange substratum of Tree and Serpent Worship;
on this the two structures seem to have been
raised, though they afterwards diverged into forms so
strangely dissimilar”</span> (p. 34).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Or again (p. 32):—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We shall probably not err far if we regard these
traces of serpent worship as indicating the presence
in the Northeast of Scotland of the head of that column
of migration, or of propagandism, which, under
the myth of Wodenism, we endeavored in a previous
chapter to trace from the Caucasus to Scandinavia.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The arbors under which two of the couples are
seated are curious instances of that sort of summer-house
which may be found adorning tea-gardens in
the neighborhood of London to the present day. It
is scenes like these that make us hesitate before asserting
that there could not possibly be any connection
between Buddhism and Wodenism”</span> (p. 140).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One of the most tempting nominal similarities
connected with this subject is suggested by the name
of Mâyâ. The mother of Buddha was called Mâyâ.
The mother of Mercury was also Maia, the daughter
of Atlas. The Romans always called Wodin, Mercury,
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies Mercurii</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Wodensday</span></span> alike designated
the fourth day of the week.... These and
other similarities have been frequently pointed out
and insisted upon, and they are too numerous and
too distinct not to have some foundation in reality”</span>
(p. 186, note).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Statements like these cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed
or uncontradicted, particularly if supported
by the authority of a great name; and after having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spoken so freely of the unscientific character of the
mythological comparisons instituted by scholars like
Sir William Jones and Lieutenant Wilford, who can
no longer defend themselves, it would be mere cowardice
to shrink from performing the same unpleasant
duty in the case of a living writer, who has shown
that he knows how to wield the weapons both of defence
and attack.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is perfectly true that the mother of Buddha
was called Mâyâ, but it is equally true that the Sanskrit
Mâyâ cannot be the Greek Maiā. It is quite
true, also, that the fourth day of the week is called
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies Mercurii</span></span> in Latin,
and Wednesday in English;
nay, that in Sanskrit the same day is called
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Budha-dina</span></span>
or <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Budha-vâra</span></span>. But the origin of all these
names falls within perfectly historical times, and can
throw no light whatever on the early growth of mythology
and religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First of all, we have to distinguish between
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Budha</span></span> and
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Buddha</span></span>. The two names, though so
like each other, and therefore constantly mistaken
one for the other, have nothing in common but their
root. <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Buddha</span></span>
with two d's, is the participle of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">budh</span></span>,

when the Hindus received from the Greeks a knowledge
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the planets, the name of the planet Mercury.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is well known that the names of the seven days
of the week are derived from the names of the planets,<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a>
and it is equally well known that in Europe the
system of weeks and week-days is comparatively of
very modern origin. It was not a Greek, nor a Roman,
nor a Hindu, but a Jewish or Babylonian invention.
The Sabbath (Sabbata) was known and
kept at Rome in the first century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span> with many
superstitious practices. It is mentioned by Horace,
Ovid, Tibullus (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies Saturni</span></span>), Persius,
Juvenal. Ovid calls it a day <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">rebus minus apta
gerendis</span></span>.”</span> Augustus (Suet. <span class="tei tei-q">“Aug.”</span> c. 76) evidently imagined
that the Jews fasted on their Sabbath, for he said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Not even a Jew keeps the fast of the Sabbath so
strictly as I have kept this day.”</span> In fact, Josephus
(<span class="tei tei-q">“Contra Apion.”</span> ii. 39) was able to say that there
was no town, Greek or not Greek, where the custom
observing the seventh day had not spread.<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a>
It is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
curious that we find the seventh day, the Sabbath,
even under its new Pagan name, as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies
Saturni</span></span> or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Kronike</span></span>, mentioned by
Roman and Greek writers, before the names of the other days of the week made
their appearance. Tibullus speaks of the day of
Saturn, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies Saturni</span></span>; Julius Frontinus
(under Nerva, 96-98) says that Vespasian attacked the Jews on
the day of Saturn, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies Saturni</span></span>; and Justin
Martyr (died 165) states that Christ was crucified the day
before the day of Kronos, and appeared to his disciples
the day after the day of Kronos. He does not
use the names of Friday and Sunday. Sunday, as
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies Solis</span></span>, is mentioned by Justin Martyr
(<span class="tei tei-q">“Apolog.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
i. 67), and by Tertullian (died 220), the usual name
of that day amongst Christians being the Lord's-day,
Κυριακή, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dominica</span></span> or
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dominicus</span></span>. Clemens of Alexandria
(died 220) seems to have been the first who
used the names of Wednesday and Friday, Ἑρμοῦ καὶ
Ἀφροδίτης ἡμέρα.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is generally stated, on the authority of Cassius
Dio, that the system of counting by weeks and weekdays
was first introduced in Egypt, and that at his
time, early in the third century, the Romans had
adopted it, though but recently. Be this as it may,
it would seem that, if Tibullus could use the name of
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies Saturni</span></span> for Saturday, the whole system
of weekdays must have been settled and known at Rome in
his time. Cassius Dio tells us that the names were
assigned to each day διὰ τεσσάρων, by fours; or by giving
the first hour of the week to Saturn, then giving
one hour to each planet in succession, till the twenty-fifth
hour became again the first of the next day.
Both systems lead to the same result, as will be seen
from the following table:—

After the names of the week-days had once been
settled, we have no difficulty in tracing their migration
towards the East and towards the West. The
Hindus had their own peculiar system of reckoning
days and months, but they adopted at a later time the
foreign system of counting by weeks of seven days,
and assigning a presiding planetary deity to each of
the seven days, according to the system described
above. As the Indian name of the planet Mercury
was Budha, the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies Mercurii</span></span> was naturally
called <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Budha-vâra</span></span> but never
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Buddha-vâra</span></span>; and the
fact that the mother of Mercury was called Maia, and
the mother of Buddha Mâyâ, could, therefore, have
had no bearing whatever on the name assigned to the
Indian Wednesday.<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> The very Buddhists, in Ceylon,
distinguish between buddha, the enlightened, and
budha, wise, and call Wednesday the day of Budha,
not of Buddha.<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> Whether the names of the planets
were formed in India independently, or after Greek
models, is difficult to settle. The name of Budha, the
knowing or the clever, given to the planet Mercury,
seems, however, inexplicable except on the latter hypothesis.

Having traced the origin of the Sanskrit name of
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies Mercurii</span></span>, Budha-vâra, let us now
see why the Teutonic nations, though perfectly ignorant of
Buddhism, called the same day the day of Wodan.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the Teutonic nations received the names of
the week-days from their Greek and Roman neighbors
admits of no doubt. For commercial and military
arrangements between Romans and Germans
some kind of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lingua franca</span></span> must soon have sprung up,
and in it the names of the week-days must have found
their place. There would have been little difficulty
in explaining the meaning of Sun-day and Mon-day
to the Germans, but in order to make them understand
the meaning of the other names, some explanations
must have been given on the nature of the
different deities, in order to enable the Germans to
find corresponding names in their own language. A
Roman would tell his German friend that <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies

<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Mercury</span></span>,
the character which they share in common, and which
led to their identification, being most likely their love

with the German <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Tiu</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ziu</span></span>, a name which,
though originally the same as <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Zeus</span></span> in Greek
or <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Dyaus</span></span> in Sanskrit, took a peculiarly
national character among the Germans, and became their god of
war.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a>

There remained thus only the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies Saturni</span></span>,
the day of Saturn, and whether this was called so in
imitation of the Latin name, or after an old German
deity of a similar name and character, is a point
which for the present we must leave unsettled.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What, however, is not unsettled is this, that if the
Germans, in interpreting these names of Roman deities
as well as they could, called the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dies
Mercurii</span></span>, the same day which the Hindus had called the day
of <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Budha</span></span> (with one
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>), their day of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Wuotan</span></span>, this
was not because <span class="tei tei-q">“the doctrines of the gentle ascetic
existed in the bosom of Odin or his followers, while
dwelling near the roots of the Caucasus,”</span> but for
very different and much more tangible reasons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, apart from all this, by what possible process
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
could Buddha and Odin have ever been brought together
in the flesh? In the history of ancient religions,
Odin belongs to the same stratum of mythological
thought as <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Dyaus</span></span> in India,
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Zeus</span></span> in Greece,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Jupiter</span></span> in Italy. He was worshipped as the
supreme deity during a period long anterior to the age of the
Veda and of Homer. His travels in Greece, and even
in Tyrkland,<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>
and his half-historical character as a
mere hero and a leader of his people, are the result
of the latest Euhemerism. Buddha, on the contrary,
is not a mythological, but a personal and historical
character, and to think of a meeting of Buddha and
Odin, or even of their respective descendants, at the
roots of Mount Caucasus, would be like imagining an
interview between Cyrus and Odin, between Mohammed
and Aphrodite.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A comparative study of ancient religions and mythologies,
as will be seen from these instances, is not
a subject to be taken up lightly. It requires not only
an accurate acquaintance with the minutest details of
comparative philology, but a knowledge of the history
of religions which can hardly be gained without
a study of original documents. As long, however, as
researches of this kind are carried on for their own
sake, and from a mere desire of discovering truth,
without any ulterior objects, they deserve no blame,
though, for a time, they may lead to erroneous results.
But when coincidences between different religions
and mythologies are searched out simply in support
of preconceived theories, whether by the friends
or enemies of religion, the sense of truth, the very
life of all science, is sacrificed, and serious mischief
will follow without fail. Here we have a right, not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only to protest, but to blame. There is on this account
a great difference between the books we have
hitherto examined, and a work lately published in
Paris by M. Jacolliot, under the sensational title of
<span class="tei tei-q">“La Bible dans l'Inde, Vie de Jeseus Christna.”</span> If
this book had been written with the pure enthusiasm
of Lieutenant Wilford, it might have been passed by
as a mere anachronism. But when one sees how its
author shuts his eyes against all evidence that would
tell against him, and brings together, without any
critical scruples, whatever seems to support his theory
that Christianity is a mere copy of the ancient religion
of India, mere silence would not be a sufficient
answer. Besides, the book has lately been translated
into English, and will be read, no doubt, by many
people who cannot test the evidence on which it professes
to be founded. We learn that M. Jacolliot
was some years ago appointed President of the Court
of Justice at Chandernagore, and that he devoted the
leisure left him from the duties of his position to
studying Sanskrit and the holy books of the Hindus.
He is said to have put himself in communication with
the Brahmans, who had obtained access to a great
number of MSS. carefully stored up in the depths of
the pagodas. <span class="tei tei-q">“The purport of his book is”</span> (I quote
from a friendly critic), <span class="tei tei-q">“that our civilization, our religion,
our legends, our gods, have come to us from
India, after passing in succession through Egypt, Persia,
Judea, Greece, and Italy.”</span> This statement, we
are told, is not confined to M. Jacolliot, but has been
admitted by almost all Oriental scholars. The Old
and New Testaments are found again in the Vedas,
and the texts quoted by M. Jacolliot in support of his
theory are said to leave it without doubt. Brahma
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
created Adima (in Sanskrit, the first man) and gave
him for companion Heva (in Sanskrit, that which
completes life). He appointed the island of Ceylon
for their residence. What follows afterwards is so
beautifully described that I may be pardoned for
quoting it. Only I must warn my readers, lest the
extract should leave too deep an impression on their
memory, that what M. Jacolliot calls a simple translation
from Sanskrit is, as far as I can judge, a simple
invention of some slightly mischievous Brahman, who,
like the Pandits of Lieutenant Wilford, took advantage
of the zeal and credulity of a French judge:—

But much more extraordinary things are quoted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by M. Jacolliot, from the Vedas and the commentaries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On p. 63 we read that Manu, Minos, and Manes,
had the same name as Moses; on p. 73, the Brahmans
who invaded India are represented as the successors
of a great reformer called Christna. The
name of Zoroaster is derived from the Sanskrit Sûryastara
(p. 110), meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“he who spreads the worship
of the Sun.”</span> After it has been laid down (p.
116) that Hebrew was derived from Sanskrit, we are
assured that there is little difficulty in deriving Jehovah
from Zeus.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>
Zeus, Jezeus, Jesus, and Isis are all
declared to be the same name, and later on (p. 130)
we learn that <span class="tei tei-q">“at present the Brahmans who officiate
in the pagodas and temples give this title of Jeseus—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span></span>
the pure essence, the divine emanation—to
Christna only, who alone is recognized as the Word,
the truly incarnated, by the worshippers of Vish<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>u
and the freethinkers among the Brahmans.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are assured that the Apostles, the poor fishermen
of Galilee, were able to read the Veda (p. 356);
and it was their greatest merit that they did not
reject the miraculous accounts of the Vedic period,
because the world was not yet ripe for freedom of
thought. Kristna, or Christna, we read on p. 360,
signified in Sanskrit, sent by God, promised by God,
holy; and as the name of Christ or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Christos</span></span> is not
Hebrew, whence could it have been taken except
from Krishna, the son of Devakî, or, as M. Jacolliot
writes, Devanaguy?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is difficult, nay, almost impossible, to criticise
or refute such statements, and yet it is necessary to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
do so; for such is the interest, or I should rather
say the feverish curiosity, excited by anything that
bears on ancient religion, that M. Jacolliot's book
has produced a very wide and very deep impression.
It has been remarked with some surprise that Vedic
scholars in Europe had failed to discover these important
passages in the Veda which he has pointed
out, or, still worse, that they had never brought
them to the knowledge of the public. In fact, if
anything was wanting to show that a general knowledge
of the history of ancient religion ought to form
part of our education, it was the panic created by M.
Jacolliot's book. It is simply the story of Lieutenant
Wilford over again, only far less excusable now than
a hundred years ago. Many of the words which M.
Jacolliot quotes as Sanskrit are not Sanskrit at all;
others never have the meaning which he assigns to
them; and as to the passages from the Vedas (including
our old friend the Bhagaveda-gîta), they are
not from the Veda, they are not from any old Sanskrit
writer—they simply belong to the second half
of the nineteenth century. What happened to Lieutenant
Wilford has happened again to M. Jacolliot.
He tells us the secret himself:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One day,”</span> he says (p. 280), <span class="tei tei-q">“when we were
reading the translation of Manu, by Sir W. Jones, a
note led us to consult the Indian commentator, Kullûka
Bha<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tt</span></span>a, when we found an allusion to the sacrifice
of a son by his father prevented by God himself
after he had commanded it. We then had only one
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">idée fixe</span></span>—namely, to find again in the dark
mass of the religious books of the Hindu, the original account
of that event. We should never have succeeded but
for <span class="tei tei-q">‘the complaisance’</span> of a Brahman with whom we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were reading Sanskrit, and who, yielding to our request,
brought us from the library of his pagoda the
works of the theologian Ramatsariar, which have
yielded us such precious assistance in this volume.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the story of the son offered as a sacrifice by
his father, and released at the command of the gods,
M. Jacolliot might have found the original account
of it from the Veda, both text and translation, in
my <span class="tei tei-q">“History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature.”</span> He
would soon have seen that the story of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">S</span></span>una<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hs</span></span>epa
being sold by his father in order to be sacrificed in
the place of an Indian prince, has very little in common
with the intended sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham.
M. Jacolliot has, no doubt, found out by this time
that he has been imposed upon; and if so, he ought
to follow the example of Colonel Wilford, and publicly
state what has happened. Even then, I doubt
not that his statements will continue to be quoted
for a long time, and that <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Adima</span></span>
and <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Heva</span></span>, thus
brought to life again, will make their appearance in
many a book and many a lecture-room.

Lest it be supposed that such accidents happen to
Sanskrit scholars only, or that this fever is bred only
in the jungles of Indian mythology, I shall mention
at least one other case which will show that this disease
is of a more general character, and that want of
caution will produce it in every climate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before the discovery of Sanskrit, China had stood
for a long time in the place which was afterwards
occupied by India. When the ancient literature and
civilization of China became first known to the scholars
of Europe, the Celestial Empire had its admirers
and prophets as full of enthusiasm as Sir W. Jones
and Lieutenant Wilford, and there was nothing,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whether Greek philosophy or Christian morality, that
was not supposed to have had its first origin among
the sages of China. The proceedings of the Jesuit
missionaries in China were most extraordinary. They
had themselves admitted the antiquity of the writings
of Confucius and Lao-tse, both of whom lived in
the sixth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span><a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> But in their zeal to show
that the sacred books of the Chinese contained numerous
passages borrowed from the Bible, nay, even
some of the dogmas of the later Church, they hardly
perceived that, taking into account the respective
dates of these books, they were really proving that a
kind of anticipated Christianity had been accorded to
the ancient sages of the Celestial Empire. The most
learned advocate of this school was Father Prémare.
Another supporter of the same view, Montucci,<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“We find in it so many sayings clearly referring
to the triune God, that no one who has read this
book can doubt that the mystery of the most holy
Trinity was revealed to the Chinese more than five
centuries before the advent of Christ. Everybody,
therefore, who knows the strong feeling of the Chinese
for their own teachers, will admit that nothing
more efficient could be found in order to fix the dogmas
of the Christian religion in the mind of the Chinese
than the demonstration that these dogmas agree
with their own books. The study, therefore, and the
translation of this singular book (the Tao-te-king)
would prove most useful to the missionaries, in order
to bring to a happy issue the desired gathering in of

What followed is so extraordinary that, though
it has often been related, it deserves to be related
again, more particularly as the whole problem which
was supposed to have been solved once for all by M.
Stanislas Julien, has of late been opened again by
Dr. von Strauss, in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Journal of the German Oriental
Society,”</span> 1869.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a passage at the beginning of the fourteenth
chapter of the Tao-te-king in which Father
Amyot felt certain that the three Persons of the
Trinity could be recognized. He translated it:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He who is as it were visible but cannot be seen
is called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Khi</span></span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He whom we cannot hear, and who does not
speak to our ear, is called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Hi</span></span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He who is as it were tangible, but cannot be
touched, is called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Wei</span></span>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Few readers, I believe, would have been much
startled by this passage, or would have seen in it
what Father Amyot saw. But more startling revelations
were in store. The most celebrated Chinese
scholar of his time, Abel Rémusat, took up the subject;
and after showing that the first of the three
names had to be pronounced, not Khi, but I, he
maintained that the three syllables I Hi Wei, were
meant for <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Je-ho-vah</span></span>. According to him, the three
characters employed in this name have no meaning
in Chinese; they are only signs of sounds foreign to
the Chinese language; and they were intended to
render the Greek Ἰαῶ, the name which, according
to Diodorus Siculus, the Jews gave to their God.
Rémusat goes on to remark that Lao-tse had really
rendered this Hebrew name more accurately than the
Greeks, because he had preserved the aspiration of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the second syllable, which was lost in Greek. In
fact, he entertained no doubt that this word, occurring
in the work of Lao-tse, proves an intellectual
communication between the West and China, in the
sixth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fortunately, the panic created by this discovery
did not last long. M. Stanislas Julien published in
1842 a complete translation of this difficult book;
and here all traces of the name of Jehovah have disappeared.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The three syllables,</span> he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“which Abel
Rémusat considered as purely phonetic and foreign
to the Chinese language, have a very clear and intelligible
meaning, and have been fully explained by
Chinese commentators. The first syllable, I, means
without color; the second, Hi, without sound or
voice; the third, Wei, without body. The proper
translation therefore is:—”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You look (for the Tao, the law) and you see it
not: it is colorless.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You listen and you hear it not: it is voiceless.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You wish to touch it and you reach it not: it is
without body.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Until, therefore, some other traces can be discovered
in Chinese literature proving an intercourse
between China and Judæa in the sixth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span>,
we can hardly be called upon to believe that the
Jews should have communicated this one name,
which they hardly trusted themselves to pronounce
at home, to a Chinese philosopher; and we must
treat the apparent similarity between I-Hi-Wei and
Jehovah as an accident, which ought to serve as a
useful warning, though it need in no way discourage
a careful and honest study of Comparative Theology.

The remarks which I venture to offer in these pages
on the corrupt state of the present spelling of English,
and on the advantages and disadvantages connected
with a reform of English orthography, were written
in fulfillment of a promise of very long standing.
Ever since the publication of the Second Volume of
my <span class="tei tei-q">“Lectures on the Science of Language,”</span> in 1863,
where I had expressed my sincere admiration for the
courage and perseverance with which Mr. Isaac Pitman
and some of his friends (particularly Mr. A. J.
Ellis, for six years his most active associate) had fought
the battle of a reform in English spelling, Mr. Pitman
had been requesting me to state more explicitly than
I had done in my <span class="tei tei-q">“Lectures”</span> my general approval
of his life-long endeavors. He wished more particularly
that I should explain why I, though by profession
an etymologist, was not frightened by the
specter of phonetic spelling, while such high authorities
as Archbishop Trench and Dean Alford had declared
that phonetic spelling would necessarily destroy
the historical and etymological character of the English
language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If I ask myself why I put off the fulfillment of my
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
promise from year to year, the principal reason I find
is, that really I had nothing more to say than what,
though in few words, I had said before. Every thing
that can be said on this subject has been said, and well
said, not only by Mr. Pitman, but by a host of writers
and lecturers, among whom I might mention Mr. Alexander
J. Ellis, Dr. Latham, Professors Haldeman,
Whitney, and Hadley, Mr. Withers, Mr. E. Jones, Dr.
J. H. Gladstone, and many others. The whole matter is
no longer a matter for argument; and the older I
grow, the more I feel convinced that nothing vexes
people so much, and hardens them in their unbelief
and in their dogged resistance to reforms, as undeniable
facts and unanswerable arguments. Reforms
are carried by Time, and what generally prevails in
the end, are not logical deductions, but some haphazard
and frequently irrational motives. I do not
say, therefore, with Dean Swift, that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is a degree
of corruption wherein some nations, as bad as the
world is, will proceed to an amendment; till which
time particular men should be quiet.”</span> On the contrary,
I feel convinced that practical reformers, like
Mr. Pitman, should never slumber nor sleep. They
should keep their grievances before the public in
season and out of season. They should have their
lamps burning, to be ready whenever the right time
comes. They should repeat the same thing over and
over again, undismayed by indifference, ridicule, contempt,
and all the other weapons which the lazy world
knows so well how to employ against those who venture
to disturb its peace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I myself, however, am not a practical reformer;
least of all in a matter which concerns Englishmen
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only—namely, the spelling of the English language.
I should much rather, therefore, have left the fight to
others, content with being merely a looker-on. But
when I was on the point of leaving England my conscience
smote me. Though I had not actually given
a pledge, I remembered how, again and again, I had
said to Mr. Pitman that I would much rather keep
than make a promise; and though overwhelmed with
other work at the time, I felt that before my departure
I ought, if possible, to satisfy Mr. Pitman's demands.
The article was written; and though my own
plans have since been changed, and I remain at Oxford,
it may as well be published in discharge of a
debt which has been for some time heavy on my conscience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What I wish most strongly to impress on my readers
is that I do not write as an advocate. I am not
an agitator for phonetic reform in England. My interest
in the matter is, and always has been, purely
theoretical and scientific. Spelling and the reform
of spelling are problems which concern every student
of the science of language. It does not matter whether
the language be English, German, or Dutch. In every
written language the problem of reforming its antiquated
spelling must sooner or later arise; and we
must form some clear notion whether any thing can
be done to remove or alleviate a complaint inherent
in the very life of language. If my friends tell me
that the idea of a reform of spelling is entirely Quixotic,
that it is a mere waste of time to try to influence
a whole nation to surrender its historical orthography
and to write phonetically, I bow to their superior wisdom
as men of the world. But as I am not a man of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the world, but rather an observer of the world, my
interest in the subject, my convictions as to what is
right and wrong, remain just the same. It is the duty
of scholars and philosophers not to shrink from holding
and expressing what men of the world call Quixotic
opinions; for, if I read the history of the world
rightly, the victory of reason over unreason, and the
whole progress of our race, have generally been
achieved by such fools as ourselves <span class="tei tei-q">“rushing in where
angels fear to tread,”</span> till, after a time, the track becomes
beaten, and even angels are no longer afraid.
I hold, and have confessed, much more Quixotic
theories on language than this belief—that what has
been done before by Spaniards and Dutchmen—what is
at this very moment being done by Germans, namely,
to reform their corrupt spelling—may be achieved even
by Englishmen and Americans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have expressed my belief that the time will come
when not only the various alphabets and systems of
spelling, but many of the languages themselves which
are now spoken in Europe, to say nothing of the rest
of the world, will have to be improved away from the
face of the earth and abolished. Knowing that nothing
rouses the ire of a Welshman or a Gael so much as
to assert the expediency, nay, necessity, of suppressing
the teaching of their languages at school, it seems
madness to hint that it would be a blessing to every
child born in Holland, in Portugal, or in Denmark—nay,
in Sweden and even in Russia—if, instead of
learning a language which is for life a barrier between
them and the rest of mankind, they were at once to
learn one of the great historical languages which confer
intellectual and social fellowship with the whole
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
world. If, as a first step in the right direction, four
languages only, namely, English, French, German,
Italian (or possibly Spanish) were taught at school,
the saving of time—and what is more precious than
time?—would be infinitely greater than what has been
effected by railways and telegraphs. But I know that
no name in any of the doomed languages would be
too strong to stigmatize such folly. We should be
told that a Japanese only could conceive such an
idea; that for a people deliberately to give up its
language was a thing never heard of before; that a
nation would cease to be a nation if it changed its
language; that it would, in fact, commit <span class="tei tei-q">“the happy
despatch,”</span> <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">à la Japonaise</span></span>.
All this may be true, but
I hold that language is meant to be an instrument
of communication, and that in the struggle for life,
the most efficient instrument of communication must
certainly carry the day, as long as natural selection,
or, as we formerly called it, reason, rules the world.

But I shall say no more on this, for as it is, I know
I shall never hear the end of it, and shall go down
to posterity, if for nothing else, at least for this the
most suicidal folly in a student of languages; a folly
comparable only to that of Leibniz, who actually conceived
the possibility of one universal language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To return, however, to the problem to the solution
of which Mr. Pitman has devoted the whole of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
active life, let me say again that my interest in it is
purely philological; or, if you like, historical. The
problem which has to be solved in England and the
United States of America is not a new one, nor an
isolated one. It occurs again and again in the history
of language; in fact, it must occur. When languages
are reduced to writing, they are at first written phonetically,
though always in a very rough-and-ready
manner. One dialect, that of the dominant, the literary,
or priestly character, is generally selected; and
the spelling, once adopted, becomes in a very short
time traditional and authoritative. What took place
thousands of years ago, we can see taking place, if we
like, at the present moment. A missionary from the
island of Mangaia, the Rev. W. Gill, first introduced
the art of writing among his converts. He learned
their language, at least one dialect of it, he translated
part of the Bible into it, and adopted, of necessity, a
phonetic spelling. That dialect is gradually becoming
the recognized literary language of the whole island,
and his spelling is taught at school. Other dialects,
however, continue to be spoken, and they may in time
influence the literary dialect. For the present, however,
the missionary dialect, as it is called by the
natives themselves, and the missionary spelling, rule
supreme, and it will be some time before a spelling
reform is wanted out there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the more ancient nations of Europe, not
only does the pronunciation of language maintain its
inherent dialectic variety, and fluctuate through the
prevalence of provincial speakers, but the whole body
of a language changes, while yet the spelling, once
adopted in public documents, and taught to children,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
remains for a long time the same. In early times,
when literature was in its infancy, when copies of
books could easily be counted, and when the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">norma
scribendi</span></span> was in the hands of a few persons, the difficulty
of adapting the writing to the ever-varying pronunciation
of a language was comparatively small.
We see it when we compare the Latin of early Roman
inscriptions with the Latin of Cicero. We know from
Cicero himself that when he settled among the patricians
of Rome, he had on some small points to change
both his pronunciation and his spelling of Latin.
The reform of spelling was a favorite subject with
Roman scholars, and even emperors were not too
proud to dabble in inventing new letters and diacritical
signs. The difficulty, however, never assumes
serious proportions. The small minority of people
who were able to read and write, pleased themselves
as best they could; and, by timely concessions, prevented
a complete estrangement between the written
and the spoken language.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then came the time when Latin ceased to be Latin,
and the vulgar dialects, such as Italian, French, and
Spanish took its place. At that time the spelling was
again phonetic, though here and there tinged by reminiscences
of Latin spelling. There was much variety,
but considering how limited the literary intercourse
must have been between different parts of France,
Spain, or Italy, it is surprising that on the whole there
should have been so much uniformity in the spelling
of these modern dialects. A certain local and individual
freedom of spelling, however, was retained;
and we can easily detect in mediæval MSS. the spelling
of literate and illiterate writers, the hand of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the learned cleric, the professional clerk, and the layman.

[A style of spelling will now be introduced which
has received the name of Semiphonotypy. It requires
no new letter: <span class="tei tei-q">“[D] [p]”</span> for the vowel in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">son</span></em>, are
made from <span class="tei tei-q">“D p”</span> by a pen-knife. The short vowels,
diphthongs, and consonants are all written phonetically,
except an occasional <span class="tei tei-q">“n”</span> = <span class="tei tei-q">“[n]”</span> before <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span> and

vowels in the old spelling. Six syllables out of seven
are thus written as in full phonotypy. The italic and

It is probably in the recollection of some of the
senior members of this Society how wide and deep
an interest was excited in the year 1853 by the publication
of Stanislas Julien's translation of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Life
and Travels of Hiouen-thsang.”</span> The account given
by an eye-witness of the religious, social, political,
and literary state of India at the beginning of the
seventh century of our era was like a rocket, carrying
a rope to a whole crew of struggling scholars, on the
point of being drowned in the sea of Indian chronology;
and the rope was eagerly grasped by all,
whether their special object was the history of Indian
religion, or the history of Indian literature, architecture,
or politics. While many books on Indian
literature, published five-and-twenty years ago, are
now put aside and forgotten, Julien's three volumes
of Hiouen-thsang still maintain a fresh interest, and
supply new subjects for discussion, as may be seen
even in the last number of the Journal of your Society.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had the honor and pleasure of working with
Stanislas Julien, when he was compiling those large
lists of Sanskrit and Chinese words which formed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the foundation of his translation of Hiouen-thsang,
and enabled him in his classical work, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Méthode
pour déchiffrer et transcrire les noms Sanskrits”</span>
(1861), to solve a riddle which had puzzled Oriental
scholars for a long time—viz., how it happened that
the original Sanskrit names had been so completely
disguised and rendered almost unrecognizable in the
Chinese translations of Sanskrit texts, and how they
could be restored to their original form.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had likewise the honor and pleasure of working
with your late President, Professor H. H. Wilson,
when, after reading Julien's works, he conceived
the idea that some of the original Sanskrit texts of
which the Chinese translations had been recovered
might still be found in the monasteries of China.
His influential position as President of your Society,
and his personal relations with Sir John Bowring,
then English Resident in China, enabled him to set
in motion a powerful machinery for attaining his
object; and if you look back some five-and-twenty
years, you will find in your Journal a full account of
the correspondence that passed between Professor
Wilson, Sir J. Bowring, and Dr. Edkins, on the
search after Sanskrit MSS. in the temples or monasteries
of China.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On February 15, 1854, Professor Wilson writes
from Oxford to Sir John Bowring:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I send you herewith a list of the Sanskrit works
carried to China by Hwen Tsang in the middle of
the seventh century, and in great part translated by
him, or under his supervision, into Chinese. If any
of them, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">especially the originals</span></em>, should be still in
existence, you would do good service to Sanskrit
literature and to the history of Buddhism by procuring
copies.”</span>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chinese Translators of Sanskrit Texts.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a well-known fact that, even long before the
time of Hiouen-thsang—that is, long before the
seventh century of our era—large numbers of Sanskrit
MSS. had been exported to China. These literary
exportations began as early as the first century
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> When we read for the first time of commissioners
being sent to India by Ming-ti, the Emperor
of China, the second sovereign of the Eastern Han
dynasty, about 62 or 65 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>, we are told that they
returned to China with a white horse, carrying books
and images.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> And the account proceeds to state that
<span class="tei tei-q">“these books still remain, and are reverenced and
worshipped.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From that time, when Buddhism was first officially
recognized in China,<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> there is an almost unbroken
succession of importers and translators of Buddhist,
in some cases of Brahmanic texts also, till we come
to the two famous expeditions, the one undertaken
by Fa-hian in 400-415, the other by Hiouen-thsang,
629-645 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> Fa-hian's Travels were translated into
French by Abel Rémusat (1836), into English by
Mr. Beal (1869). Hiouen-thsang's Travels are well
known through Stanislas Julien's admirable translation.
Of Hiouen-thsang we are told that he brought
back from India no less than 520 fasciculi, or 657
separate works, which had to be carried by twenty-two
horses.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> He translated, or had translated, 740
works, forming 1,335 fasciculi.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I say nothing of earlier traces of Buddhism which
are supposed to occur in Chinese books. Whatever
they may amount to, we look in vain in them for evidence
of any Chinese translations of Buddhist books
before the time of the Emperor Ming-ti; and what
concerns us at present is, not the existence or the
spreading of Buddhism towards the north and east
long before the beginning of the Christian era, but
the existence of Buddhist books, so far as it can be
proved at that time by the existence of Chinese
translations the date of which can be fixed with sufficient
certainty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the following remarks on the history of these
translations I have had the great advantage of being
able to use the Annals of the Sui Dynasty (589-618),
kindly translated for me by Professor Legge. In
China the history of each dynasty was written under
the succeeding dynasty from documents which may
be supposed to be contemporaneous with the events
they relate. The account given in the Sui Chronicles
of the introduction of Buddhism and Buddhist
works into China is said to be the best general account
to be found in early Chinese literature, and the
facts here stated may be looked upon as far more
trustworthy than the notices hitherto relied upon, and
collected from Chinese writers of different dates and
different localities. I have also had the assistance of
Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio, who compared the names of the
translators mentioned in the Sui Annals with the
names as given in the K'ai-yuen-shih-kiao-mu-lu (Catalogue
of the Buddhist books compiled in the period
K'ai-yuen [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> 713-741]); and though there still
remain some doubtful points, we may rest assured
that the dates assigned to the principal Chinese translators
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and their works can be depended on as historically
trustworthy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to the period anterior to Ming-ti, the
Sui Chronicles tell us that after an investigation of
the records, it was known that Buddhism had not
been brought to China previously to the Han dynasty
(began 206 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span>), though some say that it had long
been spread abroad, but had disappeared again in the
time of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kh</span></span>in<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>
(221-206 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span>). Afterwards, however,
when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">K</span></span>ang-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kh</span></span>ien was sent on a mission to the
regions of the West (about 130 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B. C.</span></span>), he is supposed
to have become acquainted with the religion of
Buddha. He was made prisoner by the Hiungnu
(Huns),<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> and, being kept by them for ten years, he
may well have acquired during his captivity some
knowledge of Buddhism, which at a very early time
had spread from Cabul<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> towards the north and the
east.

only.

The first official recognition of Buddhism in China
dates from the reign of the Emperor Ming-ti, and the
following account, though not altogether free from a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

by Chinese scholars: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Emperor Ming-ti, of the
After Han dynasty (58-75 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>), dreamt that a
man of metal (or golden color) was flying and walking
in a courtyard of the palace. When he told his
dream in the Court, Fu-î said that the figure was
that of Buddha. On this the Emperor sent the gentleman-usher
Tsâi-yin and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kh</span></span>in-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span>ing (who must then

an image.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An earlier account of the same event is to be found
in the Annals of the After (or Eastern) Han dynasty
(25-120 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>). These annals were compiled by
Fan-yeh, who was afterwards condemned to death as
a rebel (445 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>). Here we read<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> (vol. 88, fol.
8 a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seq.</span></span>): <span class="tei tei-q">“There is a tradition that the Emperor
Ming-ti (58-75 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>) dreamt that there was a giant-like
man of golden color,<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> whose head was refulgent.
The Emperor wanted his retainers to interpret it.
Then some said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘There is a god (or spirit) in the
West who is called Fo, whose height is sixteen feet,
and of golden color.’</span> Having heard this, the Emperor
at once sent messengers to Tien-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span>u
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span></span> India), to
inquire after the doctrine of Buddha. Subsequently,
copies of the image of Buddha were drawn in the
middle country (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span></span> China).”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The emissaries whom the Emperor Ming-ti had
sent to India obtained a Buddhist Sûtra in forty-two
sections, and an image of Buddha, with which and

returned to the East. When Tsâi-yin approached
(the capital), he caused the book to be borne on a
white horse, and on this account the monastery of the
White Horse was built on the west of the Yung gate
of the city of Lo to lodge it. The classic was tied up
and placed in the stone house of the Lan tower, and,
moreover, pictures of the image were drawn and kept
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kh</span></span>ing-yüan tower, and at the top of the

The name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">K</span></span>û-fa-lan, however, is more difficult.

we should expect that he too bore a Sanskrit

giving his authority for such a name. The Sutra of
the forty-two sections exists in Chinese, but neither
in Sanskrit nor in Pâli, and many difficulties would

Sûtras (the Buddhist canon) and images. And the

were Vinaya, or compilations of precepts, under each

in their times of those who had been students of the
system. Altogether there were eleven classes under

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the publication of Hiouen-thsang's Travels
which roused the hopes of Professor Wilson that
some of the old Sanskrit MSS. which had been carried
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
away from India might still be discovered in
China.<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But though no pains were spared by Sir John Bowring
to carry out Professor Wilson's wishes, though
he had catalogues sent to him from Buddhist libraries,
and from cities where Buddhist compositions
might be expected to exist, the results were disappointing,
at least so far as Sanskrit texts were concerned.
A number of interesting Chinese books,
translated from Sanskrit by Hiouen-thsang and others,
works also by native Chinese Buddhists, were
sent to the library of the East India House; but
what Professor Wilson and all Sanskrit scholars with
him most desired, Sanskrit MSS., or copies of Sanskrit
MSS., were not forthcoming. Professor Wilson
showed me, indeed, one copy of a Sanskrit MS. that
was sent to him from China, and, so far as I remember,
it was the Kâla-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">K</span></span>akra,<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a> which we know as one
of the books translated from Sanskrit into Chinese.
That MS., however, is no longer to be found in the
India Office Library, though it certainly existed in
the old East India House.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The disappointment at the failure of Professor
Wilson's and Sir J. Bowring's united efforts was felt
all the more keenly because neither Sanskrit nor
Chinese scholars could surrender the conviction that,
until a very short time ago, Indian MSS. had existed
in China. They had been seen by Europeans, such
as Dr. Gutzlaff, the hard-working missionary in China,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who in a paper, written shortly before his death, and
addressed to Colonel Sykes (<span class="tei tei-q">“Journal R. A. S.”</span> 1856,
p. 73), stated that he himself had seen Pâli MSS.
preserved by Buddhist priests in China. Whether
these MSS. were in Pâli or Sanskrit would matter
little, supposing even that Dr. Gutzlaff could not
distinguish between the two. He speaks with great
contempt of the whole Buddhist literature. There
was not a single priest, he says, capable of explaining
the meaning of the Pâli texts, though some were
interlined with Chinese. <span class="tei tei-q">“A few works,”</span> he writes,
<span class="tei tei-q">“are found in a character originally used for writing
the Pâli, and may be considered as faithful transcripts
of the earliest writings of Buddhism. They
are looked upon as very sacred, full of mysteries and
deep significations, and therefore as the most precious
relics of the founder of their creed. With the
letters of this alphabet the priests perform
incantations<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a>
to expel demons, rescue souls from hell, bring
down rain on the earth, remove calamities, etc. They
turn and twist them in every shape, and maintain
that the very demons tremble at the recitation of
them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another clear proof of the existence of Sanskrit
MSS. in China is found in the account of a <span class="tei tei-q">“Trip to
Ning-po and T'hëen-t'hae,”</span> by Dr. Edkins. After
he had arrived at Fang-kwang, he ascended the Hwa-ling
hill, and at the top of the hill he describes a
small temple with a priest residing in it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Scattered
over the hill,”</span> he adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“there are various little
temples where priests reside, but the one at the
top is the most celebrated, as being the place where
Che-k'hae spent a portion of his time, worshipping
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a Sanskrit manuscript of a Buddhist classic.”</span> On
his return he arrived at the pagoda erected to the
memory of Che-k'hae, the founder of the Thëen-t'hae
system of Buddhism, in the Chin dynasty (about 580
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>). And a little farther on, situated in a deep
dell on the left, was the monastery of Kaon-ming-sze.
This is particularly celebrated for its possession of a
Sanskrit MS., written on the palm leaf, once read
and explained by Che-k'hae, but now unintelligible
to any of the followers of Buddhism in these parts.
The priests seemed to pay uncommon reverence to
this MS., which is the only one of the kind to be
found in the East of China, and thus of great importance
in a literary point of view. It is more than
1,300 years old, but is in a state of perfect preservation,
in consequence of the palm leaves, which are
written on both sides, having been carefully let into
slips of wood, which are fitted on the same central
pin, and the whole, amounting to fifty leaves, inclosed
in a rosewood box.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This may account for the unwillingness of the
priests to part with their old MSS., whether Sanskrit
or Pâli, but it proves at the same time that they still
exist, and naturally keeps up the hope that some day
or other we may still get a sight of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Materials on which Sanskrit MSS. were written.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of course, it might be said that if MSS. did not
last very long in India, neither would they do so in
China. But even then, we might expect at least
that as in India the old MSS. were copied whenever
they showed signs of decay, so they would have been
in China. Besides, the climate of China is not so
destructive as the heat and moisture of the climate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of India. In India, MSS. seldom last over a thousand
years. Long before that time paper made of
vegetable substances decays, palm-leaves and birch-bark
become brittle, and white ants often destroy
what might have escaped the ravages of the climate.
It was the duty, therefore, of Indian Rajahs to keep
a staff of librarians, who had to copy the old MSS.
whenever they began to seem unsafe, a fact which
accounts both for the modern date of most of our
Sanskrit MSS. and for the large number of copies of
the same text often met with in the same library.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The MSS. carried off to China were in all likelihood
not written on paper, or whatever we like to
call the material which Nearchus describes <span class="tei tei-q">“as cotton
well beaten together,”</span><a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a>
but on the bark of the birch
tree or on palm leaves. The bark of trees is mentioned
as a writing material used in India by Curtius;<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a>
and in Buddhist Sûtras, such as the Kara<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nd</span></span>a-vyûha
(p. 69), we actually read of bhûr<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>a, birch,
mâsi, ink, and karama (kalam), as the common
requisites for writing. MSS. written on that
material have long been known in Europe, chiefly as
curiosities (I had to write many years ago about one
of them, preserved in the Library at All Souls' College).
Of late,<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> however, they have attracted more
serious attention, particularly since Dr. Bühler discovered
in Kashmir old MSS. containing independent
rescensions of Vedic texts, written on birch bark.
One of these, containing the whole text of the Rig-Veda
Sa<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span>hitâ<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a>
with accents, was sent to me, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
though it had suffered a good deal, particularly on
the margins, it shows that there was no difficulty in
producing from the bark of the birch tree thousands
and thousands of pages of the largest quarto or even
folio size, perfectly smooth and pure, except for the
small dark lines peculiar to the bark of that tree.<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a>

At the time of Hiouen-thsang, in the seventh century,
palm leaves seem to have been the chief material
for writing. He mentions a forest of palm-trees
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Borassus flabelliformis</span></span>) near
Konka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>apura (the

prized on account of its supplying material for writing
(vol. i. p. 202, and vol. iii. p. 148). At a later
time, too, in 965, we read of Buddhist priests returning
to China with Sanskrit copies of Buddhist books
written on palm leaves (peito).<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a> If we could believe
Hiouen-thsang, the palm leaf would have been
used even so early as the first Buddhist

he says that Kâsyapa then wrote the Pi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></span>akas on palm

wing, then a leaf of a tree, then a leaf for writing. Pa<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tt</span></span>a,
also, which is used in the sense of a sheet, was originally
pattra, a wing, a leaf of a tree.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such MSS., written on palm leaves, if preserved
carefully and almost worshipped, as they seem to
have been in China, might well have survived to the
present day, and they would certainly prove of immense
value to the students of Buddhism, if they
could still be recovered, whether in the original or
even in later copies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is true, no doubt, that, like all other religions,
Buddhism too had its periods of trial and persecution
in China. We know that during such periods—as,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for instance, in 845, under the Emperor Wu-tsung—monasteries
were destroyed, images broken, and books
burnt. But these persecutions seem never to have
lasted long, and when they were over, monasteries,
temples, and pagodas soon sprang up again, images
were restored, and books collected in greater abundance
than ever. Dr. Edkins tells us that <span class="tei tei-q">“in an
account of the Ko-t'sing monastery in the History of
T'ian-t'ai-shan it is said that a single work was saved
from a fire there several centuries ago, which was
written on the Pei-to (Pe-ta) or palm leaf of India.”</span>
He also states that great pagodas were built
on purpose as safe repositories of Sanskrit MSS., one
being erected by the Emperor for the preservation of
the newly arrived Sanskrit books at the request of
Hiouen-thsang, lest they should be injured for want
of care. It was 180 feet high, had five stories with
grains of She-li (relics) in the centre of each, and
contained monuments inscribed with the prefaces
written by the Emperor or Prince Royal to Hiouen-thsang's
translations.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Search for Sanskrit MSS. in Japan.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Being myself convinced of the existence of old Indian
MSS. in China, I lost no opportunity, during
the last five-and-twenty years, of asking any friends
of mine who went to China to look out for these
treasures, but—with no result!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some years ago, however, Dr. Edkins, who had
taken an active part in the search instituted by Professor
Wilson and Sir J. Bowring, showed me a book
which he had brought from Japan, and which contained
a Chinese vocabulary with Sanskrit equivalents
and a transliteration in Japanese. The Sanskrit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is written in that peculiar alphabet which we
find in the old MSS. of Nepâl, and which in China
has been further modified, so as to give it an almost
Chinese appearance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That MS. revived my hopes. If such a book was
published in Japan, I concluded that there must have
been a time when such a book was useful there—that
is to say, when the Buddhists in Japan studied
Sanskrit. Dr. Edkins kindly left the book with me,
and though the Sanskrit portion was full of blunders,
yet it enabled me to become accustomed to that peculiar
alphabet in which the Sanskrit words are written.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While I was looking forward to more information
from Japan, good luck would have it that a young
Buddhist priest, Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio, came to me from
Japan, in order to learn Sanskrit and Pâli, and thus
to be able in time to read the sacred writings of the
Buddhists in their original language, and to compare
them with the Chinese and Japanese translations
now current in his country. After a time, another
Buddhist priest, Mr. Kasawara, came to me for the
same purpose, and both are now working very hard
at learning Sanskrit. Japan is supposed to contain
34,388,504 inhabitants, all of whom, with the exception
of about 1 or 200,000 followers of the Shintô religion,<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>
are Buddhists, divided into ten principal sects,
the sect to which Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio belongs being
that of the Shinshiu. One of the first questions
which I asked Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio, when he came to
read Sanskrit with me, was about Sanskrit MSS. in
Japan. I showed him the Chinese-Sanskrit-Japanese
Vocabulary which Dr. Edkins had left with me, and
he soon admitted that Sanskrit texts in the same alphabet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
might be found in Japan, or at all events in
China. He wrote home to his friends, and after
waiting for some time, he brought me in December
last a book which a Japanese scholar, Shuntai Ishikawa,
had sent to me, and which he wished me
to correct, and then to send back to him to Japan.
I did not see at once the importance of the book.
But when I came to read the introductory formula,
Evam mayâ srutam, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus by me it has been
heard,”</span> the typical beginning of the Buddhist Sûtras,
my eyes were opened. Here, then, was what I had
so long been looking forward to—a Sanskrit text,
carried from India to China, from China to Japan,
written in the peculiar Nepalese alphabet, with a
Chinese translation, and a transliteration in Japanese.
Of course, it is a copy only, not an original
MS.; but copies presuppose originals at some time or
other, and, such as it is, it is a first instalment, which
tells us that we ought not to despair, for where one
of the long-sought-for literary treasures that were
taken from India to China, and afterwards from
China to Japan, has been discovered, others are sure
to come to light.

I hope that Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio will soon give us a
trustworthy account of the ancient history of his
country, drawn from native authorities. What is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
told us about the conversion of Japan to Buddhism
has a somewhat legendary aspect, and I shall only select
a few of the more important facts, as they have
been communicated to me by my Sanskrit pupil.
Buddhism first reached Japan, not directly from
China, but from Corea, which had been converted to
Buddhism in the fourth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> In the year
200 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> Corea had been conquered by the Japanese
Empress Zingu, and the intercourse thus established
between the two countries led to the importation of
Buddhist doctrines from Corea to Japan. In the
year 552 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> one of the Corean kings sent a bronze
statue of Buddha and many sacred books to the
Court of Japan, and after various vicissitudes, Buddhism
became the established religion of the island
about 600 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> Japanese students were sent to
China to study Buddhism, and they brought back
with them large numbers of Buddhist books, chiefly
translations from Sanskrit. In the year 640 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>
we hear of a translation of the Sukhavatîvyûhama-hâyâna-sûtra
being read in Japan. This is the title
of the Sanskrit text now sent to me from Japan.
The translation had been made by Kô-sô-gai (in
Chinese, Khang-sang-khai), a native of Tibet, though
living in India, 252 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>, and we are told that there
had been eleven other translations of the same text.<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the teachers of these Japanese students we
find our old friend Hiouen-thsang, whom the Japanese
call Genziô. In the year 653 a Japanese priest,
Dosho by name, studied under Genziô, adopted the
views of the sect founded by him,—the Hossô sect,—and
brought back with him to Japan a compilation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of commentaries on the thirty verses of Vasubandhu,
written by Dharmapâla, and translated by
Genziô. Two other priests, Chitsû and Chitatsu,
likewise became his pupils, and introduced the famous
Abhidharma-kosha-sâstra into Japan, which
had been composed by Vasubandhu, and translated
by Genziô. They seem to have favored the Hînayâna,
or the views of the Small Vehicle (Kushashiu).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year 736 we hear of a translation of the
Buddhâvata<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span>saka-vaipulya-sûtra, by Buddhabhadra
and others<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a>
(317-419 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>), being received in Japan,
likewise of a translation of the Saddharma-pu<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nd</span></span>arîka

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, what is more important still, in the ninth
century we are told that Kukai (died 835), the
founder of the Shingon sect in Japan, was not only a
good Chinese, but a good Sanskrit scholar also. Nay,
one of his disciples, Shinnyo, in order to perfect his
knowledge of Buddhist literature, undertook a journey,
not only to China, but to India, but died before
he reached that country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These short notices, which I owe chiefly to Mr.
Bunyiu Nanjio, make it quite clear that we have
every right to expect Sanskrit MSS., or, at all events,
Sanskrit texts, in Japan, and the specimen which I
have received encourages me to hope that some of
these Sanskrit texts may be older than any which exist
at present in any part of India.

We saw before, in the historical account of Buddhism
in Japan, that no less than twelve Chinese

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But when I came to compare these Sanskrit MSS.
with the text sent to me from Japan, though the
title was the same, I soon perceived that their contents
were different. While the text, as given in the
ordinary Devanâgari or Nepalese MSS., fills about
fifty to sixty leaves, the text of the Sûtra that reached
me from Japan would hardly occupy more than eight
or ten leaves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I soon convinced myself that this MS. was not a
text abbreviated in Japan, for this shorter text, sent to
me from Japan, correspond in every respect with the
Chinese Sûtra translated by Mr. Beal in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Catena,”</span>
pp. 378-383, and published in your Journal,
1866, p. 136. No doubt the Chinese translation, on
which Mr. Beal's translation is based, is not only
free, but displays the misapprehensions peculiar to
many Chinese renderings of Sanskrit texts, due to a
deficient knowledge either of Sanskrit or of Chinese
on the part of the translators, perhaps also to the
different genius of those two languages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, such as it is, there can be no doubt that it
was meant to be a translation of the text now in my
possession. Mr. Beal tells us that the translation he
followed is that by Kumâra<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>îva, the contemporary of
Fa-hian (400 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>), and that this translator omitted
repetitions and superfluities in the text.<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> Mr. Edkins

in the Chinese translation of the shorter text the scene
is laid, as in the Japanese Sanskrit text, at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">S</span></span>râvastî,
and the principal speakers are Bhagavat and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">S</span></span>âriputra.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is also a Tibetan translation of the short
text, described by Csoma Körösi (<span class="tei tei-q">“As. Res.”</span> vol. xx.
p. 439). Here, though the name of the scene is not
mentioned, the speakers are Bhagavat and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">S</span></span>âriputra.
The whole work occupies seven leaves only, and the
names of the sixteen principal disciples agree with
the Japanese text. The translators were Pra<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>nâvarman,
Sûrendra, and the Tibetan Lotsava Ya-shes-sde.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
M. Feer informs me that there is at the National

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another text at the National Library is called
Ta-o-mi-to-king, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span></span> Mahâ Amitâbha-sûtra, and here
the scene is at Râ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>ag<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ri</span></span>ha.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have, therefore, historical evidence of the existence
of three Sûtras, describing Sukhavatî, or the
Paradise of Amitâbha. We know two of them in
Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan—one long, the
other short. The third is known as yet in Chinese
only.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the two Sanskrit texts, the one from Nepal,
the other from Japan, the latter seems certainly the
earlier. But even the fuller text must have existed
at a very early time, because it was translated by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">K</span></span>i-lau-kia-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kh</span></span>ai, under the Eastern Han
dynasty (25-220 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>)—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span></span>
at all events before 220 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The shorter text is first authenticated through
the translation of Kumâra<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>îva, about 400
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>; but
if the views generally entertained as to the relative
position of the longer and shorter Sûtras be correct,
we may safely claim for our short Sûtra a date within
the second century of our era.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What Japan has sent us is, therefore, a Sanskrit
text, of which we had no trace before, which must
have left India at least before 400 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>, but probably
before 200 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>, and which gives us the original of
that description of Amitâbha's Paradise, which formerly
we knew in a Chinese translation only, which
was neither complete nor correct.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The book sent to me was first published in Japan
in 1773, by Ziômiô, a Buddhist priest. The Sanskrit
text is intelligible, but full of inaccuracies, showing
clearly that the editor did not understand Sanskrit,
but simply copied what he saw before him. The
same words occurring in the same line are written
differently, and the Japanese transliteration simply
repeats the blunders of the Sanskrit transcript.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are two other editions of the same text,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
published in 1794 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> by another Japanese priest,
named Hôgŏ. These are in the possession of Mr.
Bunyiu Nanjio, and offered some help in correcting
the text. One of them contains the text and three
Chinese translations, one being merely a literal rendering,
while the other two have more of a literary
character and are ascribed to Kumâra<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>îva (400
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>), and Hiouen-thsang (648 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, there is another book by the same Hôgŏ,
in four volumes, in which an attempt is made to give
a grammatical analysis of the text. This, however,
as Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio informs me, is very imperfect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

text, critically restored, and a literal translation

This Sûtra sounds to us, no doubt, very different
from the original teaching of Buddha. And so it is.
Nevertheless it is the most popular and most widely
read Sûtra in Japan, and the whole religion of the
great mass of the people may be said to be founded
on it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Repeat the name of Amitâbha as often as
you can, repeat it particularly in the hour of death,
and you will go straight to Sukhavatî and be happy
forever;”</span> this is what Japanese Buddhists are asked
to believe: this is what they are told was the teaching
of Buddha. There is one passage in our Sûtra
which seems even to be pointedly directed against the
original teaching of Buddha. Buddha taught that as
a man soweth so shall he reap, and that by a stock of
good works accumulated on earth the way is opened
to higher knowledge and higher bliss. Our Sûtra
says No; not by good works done on earth, but by
a mere repetition of the name of Amitâbha is an
entrance gained into the land of bliss. This is no
better than what later Brahmanism teaches, viz.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Repeat the name of Hari or of K<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ri</span></span>sh<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>a,
and you will be saved.”</span> It is no better than what even some
Christian teachers are reported to teach. It may be
that in a lower stage of civilization even such teaching
has produced some kind of good.<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> But Japan is
surely ripe for better things. What the worship of
Amitâbha may lead to we can learn from a description
given by Dr. Edkins in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Trip to Ning-po
and T'hëen-t'hae.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The next thing,”</span> he writes,
<span class="tei tei-q">“shown to us was the prison, in which about a dozen
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
priests had allowed themselves to be shut up for a
number of months or years, during which they were
to occupy themselves in repeating the name of Amida
Buddha,<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> day and night, without intermission. During
the day the whole number were to be thus engaged;
and during the night they took it by turns,
and divided themselves into watches, so as to insure
the keeping up of the work till morning. We asked
when they were to be let out. To which it was replied,
that they might be liberated at their own request,
but not before they had spent several months
in seclusion. We inquired what could be the use of
such an endless repetition of the name of Buddha.
To which it was answered, that the constant repetition
of the sacred name had a tendency to purify the
heart, to deaden the affections towards the present
world, and to prepare them for the state of Nirvâ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>a.
It was further asked whether Buddha was likely to
be pleased with such an endless repetition of his
name. To which it was answered, that in the Western
world it was considered a mark of respect to repeat
the name of any one whom we delighted to
honor. The recluses seemed most of them young
men; some of whom came out to the bars of their
cage to look at the strangers, but kept on repeating
the name of Buddha as they stood there. It appeared
to us that nothing was more calculated to produce
idiocy than such a perpetual repetition of a single
name, and the stupid appearance of many of the
priests whom we have seen seems to have been induced
by some such process.”</span>

Is it not high time that the millions who live in
Japan, and profess a faith in Buddha, should be told
that this doctrine of Amitâbha and all the Mahâyâna
doctrine is a secondary form of Buddhism, a corruption
of the pure doctrine of the Royal Prince, and
that if they really mean to be Buddhists, they should
return to the words of Buddha, as they are preserved
to us in the old Sûtras? Instead of depending, as
they now do, on Chinese translations, not always accurate,
of degraded and degrading Mahâyâna tracts,
why should they not have Japanese translations of
the best portions of Buddha's real doctrine, which
would elevate their character, and give them a religion
of which they need not be ashamed? There are
Chinese translations of some of the better portions
of the Sacred Writings of Buddhism. They exist in
Japan too, as may be seen in that magnificent collection
of the Buddhist Tripi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></span>aka which was sent from
Japan as a present to the English Government, and
of which Mr. Beal has given us a very useful Catalogue.
But they are evidently far less considered in
Japan than the silly and the mischievous stories of
Amitâbha and his Paradise, and those which I know
from translations are far from correct.

work, after their return to Japan. And if more
young Buddhist priests are coming over, I shall always,
so far as my other occupations allow it, be
glad to teach them, and to help them in their unselfish
work. There is a great future in store, I
believe, for those Eastern Islands, which have been

In return, I hope that they and their friends in

of this Society who have friends in China or
in Japan will help, if H. E. the Japanese Minister,
Mori Arinori, who has honored us by his presence today,
will lend us his powerful assistance, I have little
doubt that the dream which passed before the mind
of your late President may still become a reality, and
that some of the MSS. which, beginning with the beginning
of our era, were carried from India to China,
Corea, and Japan, may return to us, whether in the

West in order to learn to read their sacred writings

later developments and corruptions of Buddhism.
Buddha himself, I feel convinced, never knew even
the names of Amitâbha, Avalokite<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span>vara, or Sukhavatî.
Then, how can a nation call itself Buddhist whose religion
consists chiefly in a belief in a divine Amitâbha

life in the paradise of Sukhavatî?

a number of Sanskrit-Chinese books from Japan, and
he afterwards kindly sent them to me to examine.
They were of the same appearance and character as
the dictionary which Dr. Edkins had lent me, and
the Sukhavatî-vyûha which I had received from Japan.

of the Devanâgarî letters, and that was all. Still, so
large a number of books written to teach the Sanskrit
alphabet augurs well for the existence of Sanskrit
texts. There was among Mr. Wylie's books a second
Chinese-Sanskrit-Japanese vocabulary, of which Mr.
Kasawara has given me the following account: <span class="tei tei-q">“This
vocabulary is called <span class="tei tei-q">‘A Thousand Sanskrit and Chinese
Words’</span> and it is said to have been arranged by
I-tsing, who left China for India in 671, about twenty-seven
years after Hiouen-thsang's return to China,
and who is best known as the author of a book called
Nanhae-ki-kwei-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span>ou'en, on the manners and customs
of the Indian Buddhists at that time.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This vocabulary was brought from China to Japan
by Zikaku, a Japanese priest, who went to China
in 838 and returned in 847. It is stated at the end
of the book, that in the year 884 a Japanese priest of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the name of Rioyiu copied that vocabulary from a
text belonging to another priest, Yûĭkai. The edition
brought from Japan by Mr. Wylie was published
there in the year 1727 by a priest called Jakumio.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following curious passage occurs in the preface
of Jakumio's edition: <span class="tei tei-q">“This vocabulary is generally
called <span class="tei tei-q">‘One Thousand Sanskrit and Chinese Words.’</span>
It is stated in Annen's work, that this was first
brought (from China) by Zikaku. I have corrected
several mistakes in this vocabulary, comparing many
copies; yet the present edition is not free from blunders;
I hope the readers will correct them, if they
have better copies.</span>

fourteen letters of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘siddha’</span> are written. In the

At the end of my paper on <span class="tei tei-q">“Sanskrit Texts in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sooner than expected this wish of mine has been
fulfilled. On April 28 Mr. Shigefuyu Kurihara, of
Kioto, a friend of one of my Sanskrit pupils, Mr.
Bunyiu Nanjio, who for some years had himself taken
an interest in Sanskrit, went to the temple or monastery
of Hôriuji to inquire whether any old Sanskrit
MSS. were still preserved there. He was told that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the priests of the monastery had recently surrendered
their valuables to the Imperial Government, and that
the ancient palm leaves had been presented to the
emperor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a chronicle kept at the monastery of Hôriuji it
is stated that these palm leaves and other valuables
were brought by Ono Imoko, a retainer of the Mikado
(the Empress Suiko), from China (during the
Sui dynasty, 589-618) to Japan, in the thirty-seventh
year of the age of Prince Umayado—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span></span>,

tells us that his Essay <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On Liberty</span></span> was planned and written down
in 1854. It was in mounting the steps of the Capitol in January, 1855,
that the thought first arose of converting it into a volume, and it was not
published till 1859. The author, who in his Autobiography speaks with
exquisite modesty of all his literary performances, allows himself one
single exception when speaking of his Essay <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On Liberty</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-q">“None of my writings,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“have been either so carefully composed or so
sedulously corrected as this.”</span> Its final revision was to have been the work of
the winter of 1858 to 1859, which he and his wife had arranged to pass in
the South of Europe, a hope which was frustrated by his wife's death.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Liberty</span></span>,”</span> he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“is likely to survive longer
than anything else that I have written (with the possible exception of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Logic</span></span>), because the conjunction of her mind with mine has
rendered it a kind of philosophic text-book of a single truth, which the changes
progressively taking place in modern society tend to bring out into strong relief: the
importance to man and society, of a large variety of character, and of
giving full freedom to human nature to expand itself in innumerable and

word ψυχή is clearly connected in Greek with ψύχω, which meant
originally blowing, and was used either in the sense of cooling by blowing,
or breathing by blowing. In the former acceptation it produced ψύχος,
coldness; ψυχρός, cold; ψυχάω, I cool; in the latter ψυχή, breath, then life,
then soul. So far the purely Greek growth of words derived from ψύχω is
clear. But ψύχω itself is difficult. It seems to point to a root
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">spu</span></span>, meaning

Stahl, who rejected the division of life and mind adopted by Bacon, and
returned to the Aristotelian doctrine, falls back on Plato's etymology of
ψυχή as φυσέχη, from φύσιν ἔχειν or ὀχεῖν, Crat. 400 B. In a passage of his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theoria Medica Vera</span></span> (Halæ, 1708), pointed out to me by Dr.
Rolleston, Stahl says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Invenio in lexico græco antiquiore post alios, et Budæum
imprimis, iterum iterumque reviso, nomenclaturam nimis quam fugitive
allegatam; φυσέχη, poetice, pro ψυχή. Incidit animo suspicari, an non
verum primum nomen animæ antiquissimis Græcis fuerit hoc φυσέχη, quasi
ἔχων τὸ φύειν, e cuius vocis pronunciatione deflectente, uti vere familiariter
solet vocalium, inprimis sub accentibus, fugitiva enunciatione, sensim
natum sit φυσ-χή φσυχή, denique ad faciliorem pronunciationem in locum
φσυχή, ψυχή. Quam suspicionem fovere mihi videtur illud, quod vocabuli
ψυχῆς, pro anima, nulla idonea analogia in lingua græca occurrat; nam
quæ a ψύχω ducitur, cum verus huius et directus significatus notorie sit
refrigero, indirectus autem magis, spiro, nihil certe hæc ad animam puto.”</span>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deutsche Grammatik</span></span>, ii. p. 700). He ought likewise to have known

does not always create its own heroes, but that it lays hold of real history,
and coils itself round it so closely that it is difficult, nay, almost impossible,
to separate the ivy from the oak, the lichen from the granite to which
it clings. And here is a lesson which comparative mythologists ought not
to neglect. They are naturally bent on explaining everything that can be

Very similar opinions had been advocated by Rajendralal Mitra, in a paper
published in 1858 in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Buddhism and Odinism, illustrated by extracts from Professor Holmboe's Memoir

done by opinions of this kind when they once find their way into the general
public, and are supported by names which carry weight, may be seen
by the following extracts from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pioneer</span></span> (July 30, 1878), a
native paper published in India. Here we read that the views of Holmboe, Rajendralal
Mitra, and Fergusson, as to a possible connection between Buddha and Wodan,
between Buddhism and Wodenism, have been adopted and preached by
an English bishop, in order to convince his hearers, who were chiefly Buddhists,
that the religion of the gentle ascetic came originally, if not from the
Northeast of Scotland, at all events from the Saxons. <span class="tei tei-q">“Gotama Buddha,”</span>
he maintained, <span class="tei tei-q">“was a Saxon,”</span> coming from <span class="tei tei-q">“a Saxon family which had
penetrated into India.”</span> And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“The most convincing proof to us
Anglo-Indians lies in the fact that the Purânas named Varada and Matsy
distinctly assert that the White Island in the West—meaning England—was
known in India as Sacana, having been conquered at a very early
period by the Sacas or Saks.”</span> After this the bishop takes courage, and says:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let me call your attention to the Pâli word
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Nibban</span></span>,
called in Sanskirt Nirv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">âna</span></span>. In the Anglo-Saxon you have the

<span class="tei tei-q">“The article by Max Müller in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Index</span></span> of this
week contains, I think, one error, caused doubtless by his taking a false translation
of a passage from Josephus instead of the original. <span class="tei tei-q">‘In fact,’</span> says Professor
Müller, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Josephus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Contra Apion.</span></span> ii. 39) was able to say that
there was no town, Greek or not Greek, where the custom of observing the seventh day
had not spread.’</span> Mr. Wm. B. Taylor, in a discussion of the Sabbath question
with the Rev. Dr. Brown, of Philadelphia, in 1853 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Obligation of the
Sabbath</span></span>, p. 120), gives this rendering of the passage: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Nor is there anywhere
any city of the Greeks, nor a single barbarian nation, whither the institution
of the Hebdomade (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which we mark by resting</span></em>) has not travelled;’</span>
then in a note Mr. Taylor gives the original Greek of part of the passage,
and adds: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Josephus does not say that the Greek and barbarian rested,
but that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> [the Jews] observe it by rest.’</span></span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The corrected translation only adds strength to Max Müller's position
in regard to the very limited extent of Sabbath observance in ancient
times; and Mr. Taylor brings very strong historical proof to maintain the
assertion (p. 24) that <span class="tei tei-q">‘throughout all history we discover no trace of a
Sabbath among the nations of antiquity.’</span> ”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems to me that if we read the whole of Josephus's work, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On the
Antiquity of the Jews</span></span>, we cannot fail to perceive that what Josephus wished
to show towards the end of the second book was that other nations had
copied or were trying to copy the Jewish customs. He says: Ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν τε
διηνέχθησαν οἱ νόμοι καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασιν ἀνθρώποις, ἀεὶ καὶ μᾶλλον αὐτῶν ζῆλον
ἐμπεποιήκασι.
He then says that the early Greek philosophers, though apparently
original in their theoretic speculations, followed the Jewish laws
with regard to practical and moral precepts. Then follows this sentence:
Οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ καὶ πλήθεσιν ἤδη πολὺς ζῆλος γέγονεν ἐκ μακροῦ τῆς ἡμετέρας εὐσεβείας,
οὐ δ᾽ ἔστιν οὐ πόλις Ἑλλήνων οὐδετισουν οὐδὲ βάρβαρος, οὐδὲ ἕν ἔθνος, ἔνθα
μὴ τὸ τῆς ἑβδομάδος, ἥν ἀργοῦμεν ἡμεῖς, ἔθος οὐ διαπεφοιτηκε, καὶ αἱ νηστεῖαι καὶ
λύχνων ἀνακαύσεις καὶ πολλὰ τῶν εἰς βρῶσιν ἡμῖν οὐ νενομισμένων παρατετήρηται.
Μιμεῖσθαι δὲ πειρῶνται καὶ τὴν πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἡμῶν ὁμόνοιαν, κ.τ.λ. Standing
where it stands, the sentence about the ἑβδομάς can only mean that <span class="tei tei-q">“there
is no town of Greeks nor of barbarians, nor one single people, where the
custom of the seventh day, on which we rest, has not spread, and where
fastings, and lighting of lamps, and much of what is forbidden to us with
regard to food are not observed. They try to imitate our mutual concord
also, etc.”</span> Hebdomas, which originally meant the week, is here clearly
used in the sense of the seventh day, and though Josephus may exaggerate,
what he says is certainty <span class="tei tei-q">“that there was no town, Greek or not
Greek, where the custom of observing the seventh day had not spread.”</span></p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_56" name="note_56" href="#noteref_56">56.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Grimm, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deutsche Mythologie</span></span>,

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Bombay,</span></span> 1877, p.
29) has the following interesting remarks: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Bhûrga MSS. are written
on specially-prepared thin sheets of the inner bark of the Himalayan birch
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bœtula Bhojpatr.</span></span> Wallich), and invariably in Sâradâ
characters. The lines run always parallel to the narrow side of the leaf, and the MSS.
present, therefore, the appearance of European books, not of Indian MSS.,
which owe their form to an imitation of the Tâlapatras. The Himâlaya
seems to contain an inexhaustible supply of birch bark, which in Kasmîr
and other hill countries is used both instead of paper by the shopkeepers
in the bazaars, and for lining the roofs of houses in order to make them
water-tight. It is also exported to India, where in many places it is likewise
used for wrapping up parcels, and plays an important part in the
manufacture of the flexible pipe-stems used by hukâ smokers. To give an
idea of the quantities which are brought into Srînagar, I may mention that
on one single day I counted fourteen large barges with birch bark on the
river.... The use of birch bark for literary purposes is attested by the
earliest classical Sanskrit writers. Kâlidâsa mentions it in his dramas
and epics; Sustuta, Varâhamihira (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">circa</span></span> 500-550
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span>) know it likewise. As is the case with nearly all old
customs, the use of birch bark for writing still survives in India, though the fact
is little known. Mantras, which are worn as amulets, are written on pieces of
Bhûrga with ash<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></span>au gandbâ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></span>, a
mixture of eight odoriferous substances—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e. g.</span></span>
camphor, sandal, tumeric—which vary according to the deity to which
the writing is dedicated. The custom prevails in Bengal as well as in Gujarât.
Birch-bark MSS. occur in Orissa. The Petersburg Dictionary refers to a passage
in the Kâ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">th</span></span>aka, the redaction of the Yajurveda formerly current
in Kasmîr, where the word Bhûr<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>a occurs, though it is not clear
if it is mentioned there too as material for writing on. The Kasmirian Pandits assert,
and apparently with good reason, that in Kasmîr all books were written on
bhûrgapattras from the earliest times until after the conquest of the Valley
by Akbar, about 200-250 years ago. Akbar introduced the manufacture
of paper, and thus created an industry for which Kasmîr is now famous
in India.”</span></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_116" name="note_116" href="#noteref_116">116.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Dr. Burnell,

Abhi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gñ</span></span>âta in the sense of known, famous,
occurs in Lalita-Vistara, p. 25, and the Chinese translators adopted
that meaning here. Again, if we preferred the reading

this, too, would admit of an intelligible rendering—viz. known or
distinguished by the marks or characteristics, the good qualities, that
ought to belong to a Bhikshu. But the technical meaning is <span class="tei tei-q">“possessed
of a knowledge of the five abhi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gñ</span></span>âs.”</span> It would be better in

Arhat ought to possess are the
divine sight, the divine hearing, the knowledge of the thoughts of others,
the remembrance of former existences, and magic power. See Burnouf,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lotus</span></span>, Appendice, No. xiv. The larger text of the Sukhavatîvyûha
has abhi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gñ</span></span>ânâbhi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gñ</span></span>aih, and afterwards

kaṅka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>a, bracelet, gives no sense, for what could be the meaning

One text reads Kâkapeya, the other Kâkâpeya. It is
difficult to choose. The more usual word is kâkapeya, which is explained
by Pâ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>ini, ii. 1, 33. It is uncertain, however, whether kâkapeya
is meant as a laudatory or as a depreciatory term. Boehtlingk takes it in the latter
sense, and translates nadî kâkapeyâ, by a shallow river that could be
drunk up by a crow. Târânâtha takes it in the former sense, and translates
nadî kâkapeyâ, as a river so full of water that a crow can drink it
without bending its neck (kâkair anatakandharai<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></span> pîyate;
pûr<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>odakatvena pra<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span>asye
kâkai<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></span> peye nadyâdau). In our passage kâkapeya must be
a term of praise, and we therefore could only render it by <span class="tei tei-q">“ponds so full
of water that crows could drink from them.”</span> But why should so well
known a word as kâkapeya have been spelt kâkâpeya, unless it was done
intentionally? And if intentionally, what was it intended for? We must
remember that Pâ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></span>ini, ii. 1, 42 schol., teaches us how to form
the word tîrthakâka, a crow at a tîrtha, which means a person in a wrong place.
It would seem, therefore, that crows were considered out of place at a tîrtha
or bathing-place, either because they were birds of ill omen, or because
they defiled the water. From that point of view, kâkâpeya would mean
a pond not visited by crows, free from crows. Professor Pischel has
called my attention to Mahâparinibbâna Sutta (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">J. R. A. S.</span></span> 1875,
p. 67, p. 21), where kâkapeyâ clearly refers to a full river. Samatiṭṭḥika, if this is
the right reading, occurs in the same place as an epithet of a river, by the
side of kâkapeya, and I think it most likely that it means rising to a level
with the tîrthas, the fords or bathing-places. Mr. Rhys Davids informs
me that the commentary explains the two words by samatittikâ ti samaharitâ,
kâkapeyyâ ti yatthatattha<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span>i tîre <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">th</span></span>itena

meaning of this passage, but if we enter into the bold metaphor of the text, viz., that
the Buddhas cover the Buddha-countries with the organ of their tongue and then unroll it,
what is intended can hardly be anything but that they first try to find
words for the excellences of those countries, and then reveal or proclaim
them. Burnouf, however (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lotus</span></span>, p. 417), takes the expression in a
literal sense, though he is shocked by its grotesqueness. On these Buddhas and
their countries, see Burnouf, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lotus</span></span>, p. 113.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_156" name="note_156" href="#noteref_156">156.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">It should

intended, while pa for pra may be an accident. Yet I have little doubt
that patîyatha was in the original text. That it is meant for the imperative,

Sukhavatîvyûha, even in its shortest text, is called a Mahâyâna-sûtra,
nor is there any reason why a Mahâyâna-sûtra should not be short.
The meaning of Mahâyâna-sûtra is simply a Sûtra belonging to the Mahâyâna
school, the school of the Great Boat. It was Burnouf who, in his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction to the History of Buddhism</span></span>, tried very hard to
establish a distinction between the Vaipulya or developed Sûtras, and what he calls the
simple Sûtras. Now, the Vaipulya Sûtras may all belong to the Mahâyâna
school, but that would not prove that all the Sûtras of the Mahâyâna school
are Vaipulya or developed Sûtras. The name of simple Sûtra, in opposition
to the Vaipulya or developed Sûtras, is not recognized by the Buddhists
themselves; it is really an invention of Burnouf's. No doubt there
is a great difference between a Vaipulya Sûtra, such as the Lotus of the
Good Law, translated by Burnouf, and the Sûtras which Burnouf translated
from the Divyâvadâna. But what Burnouf considers as the distinguishing
mark of a Vaipulya Sûtra, viz. the occurrence of Bodhisattvas,
as followers of the Buddha <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">S</span></span>âkyamuni, would no longer seem to be
tenable (<span class="tei tei-q">“Les présence des Bodhisattûvas ou leur absence intéresse done le fonds même
des livres où on la remarque, et il est bien évident que ce seul point trace une ligno
de démarcation profonde entre les Sûtras ordinaires et les Sûtras développés.”</span>
Burnouf. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></span>, p. 112.),
unless we classed our short Sukhavatî-vyûha as a Vaipulya or developed
Sûtra. For this there is no authority. Our Sûtra is called a
Mahâyâna Sutra, never a Vaipulya Sûtra, and yet among the followers of
Buddha, the Bodhisattvas constitute a very considerable portion. But
more than that, Amitâbha, the Buddha of Sukhavatî, another personage
whom Burnouf looks upon as peculiar to the Vaipulya Sûtras, who is, in
fact, one of the Dhyâni-buddhas, though not called by that name in our
Sûtra, forms the chief object of its teaching, and is represented as coeval
with Buddha <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">S</span></span>âkyamuni. (<span class="tei tei-q">“L'idée d'un ou de plusieurs Buddhas
surhumains, celle de Bodhisattvas créés par eux, sont des conceptions
aussi étrangères á ces livres (les Sûtras simples) que
celle d'un Adibuddha ou d'un Dieu.”</span>—Burnouf,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></span>, p. 120.) The larger text of the Sukhavatîvyûha would
certainly, according to Burnouf's definition, seem to fall into the category
of the Vaipulya Sûtras. But it is not so called in the MSS. which I have
seen, and Burnouf himself gives an analysis of that Sûtra
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></span>, p. 99) as a specimen of a Mahâyâna, but
not of a Vaipulya Sûtra.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_159" name="note_159" href="#noteref_159">159.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">See H. Yule,
